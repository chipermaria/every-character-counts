"This is hysterical! Can it really be true?? Sandy --------- Inline attachment follows --------- From:   To: Wunsch, Doris A , Sandy Taylor , gsa@monad.net, Robin , Carol Dane , Ellen Sheehan , godell@mediaone.net Date: Wednesday, January 9, 2002 9:51:00 GMT Subject:    This is really pretty funny!      _____   A Cat's Tale...  This is the story of the night my ten-year-old cat, Rudy, got his head stuck in the garbage disposal. I  knew at the time that the experience would be funny if the cat survived, so let me tell you right up front that he's fine.  Getting him out wasn't easy, though, and the process included numerous home remedies, a plumber, two cops, an emergency overnight veterinary clinic, a case of mistaken identity, five hours of panic, and fifteen minutes of fame.  First, some background. My husband, Bill, and I had just returned from a five-day spring-break vacation in the Cayman Islands, where I had been sick as a dog the  whole time, trying to convince myself that if I had to feel lousy, it was better to do it in paradise.  We had arrived home at 9 PM, a day and a half later than we had planned because of airline problems. I still had illness-related vertigo, and because of the flight delays, had not been able to prepare the class I was supposed to teach at 8:40 the next morning. I sat down at my desk to think about William Carlos Williams, and around ten o'clock I heard Bill hollering something undecipherable from the kitchen.  As I raced out to see what was wrong, I saw Bill frantically rooting around under the kitchen sink and Rudy, or rather, Rudy's headless body, scrambling around in the sink, his claws clicking in panic on the metal.  Bill had just ground up the skin of some smoked salmon in the garbage disposal, and when he left the room, Rudy (whom we always did call a pinhead) had gone in  after it.  It is very disturbing to see the headless body of your cat in the sink. This is an animal that I have slept with nightly for ten years, who burrows under the covers and purrs against my side, and who now looked like a desperate, fur-covered turkey carcass, set to defrost in the sink while it's still alive and kicking. It was also disturbing to see Bill, Mr. Calm-in-any-Emergency, at his wits end, trying to  soothe Rudy, trying to undo the garbage disposal, failing at both, and basically freaking out.  Adding to the chaos was Rudy's twin brother Lowell, also upset, racing around in circles, jumping onto the kitchen counter and alternately licking Rudy's butt for comfort and biting it out of fear. Clearly, I had to do something.  First we tried to ease Rudy out of the disposal by lubricating his head and neck. We tried Johnson's baby shampoo (kept on hand for my nieces visits) and butter-flavored Crisco: both failed, and a now-greasy Rudy kept struggling.  Bill then decided to take apart the garbage disposal, which was a good idea, but he couldn't do it. Turns out, the thing is constructed like a metal onion: you peel off one layer and another one appears, with Rudy's head still buried deep inside, stuck in a hard plastic collar. My job during this process was to sit on the kitchen counter petting Rudy, trying to calm him, with the room spinning (vertigo), Lowell howling (he's part Siamese), and Bill clattering around with tools.  When all our efforts failed, we sought professional help. I called our regular plumber, who actually called me back quickly, even at 11 o'clock at night (thanks, Dave). He talked Bill through further layers of disposal dismantling, but still we couldn't reach Rudy. I called the 1-800 number for Insinkerator (no response), a pest removal service that advertises 24-hour service (no response), an all-night emergency veterinary clinic (who had no experience in this matter, and so, no advice), and finally, in desperation, 911. I could see that Rudy's normally pink paw pads were turning blue. The fire department, I figured, gets cats out of trees; maybe they could get one out of a garbage disposal.  The dispatcher had other ideas and offered to send over two policemen. This suggestion gave me pause. I'm from the sixties, and even if I am currently a fine  upstanding citizen, I had never considered calling the cops and asking them to come to my house, on purpose.  I resisted the suggestion, but the dispatcher was  adamant: ""They'll help you out,"" he said.  The cops arrived close to midnight and turned out to be quite nice. More importantly, they were also able to think rationally, which we were not.  They were, of course, quite astonished by the situation: ""I've never seen anything like this,"" Officer Mike kept saying. (The unusual circumstances helped us get quickly on a first-name basis with our cops.)  Officer Tom expressed immediate sympathy for our plight. ""I have had cats all my life,"" he said, comfortingly. Also he had an idea. Evidently we needed a certain tool, a tiny, circular rotating saw that could cut through the heavy plastic flange encircling Rudy's neck without hurting Rudy, and Officer Tom happened to own one. ""I live just five minutes from here,"" he said; ""I'll go get it.""  He soon returned, and the three of them, Bill and the two policemen got under the sink together to cut through the garbage disposal. I sat on the counter, holding Rudy and trying not to succumb to the surreal-ness of the scene, with the weird  middle-of-the-night lighting, the rooms occasional spinning, Lowell's spooky sound effects, an apparently headless cat in my sink and six disembodied legs poking out from under it. One good thing came of this:  the guys did manage to get the bottom of the disposal, so we could now see Rudy's face and knew he could  breathe. But they couldn't cut the flange without risking the cat.  Stumped, Officer Tom had another idea. ""You know,"" he said, ""I think the reason we can't get him out is the angle of his head and body. If we could just get the  sink out and lay it on its side, I'll bet we could slip him out."" That sounded like a good idea at this point, ANYTHING would have sounded like a good idea and as it turned out, Officer Mike runs a plumbing business on weekends; he knew how to take out the sink! Again they went to work, the three pairs of legs sticking out from under the sink surrounded by an ever-increasing pile of tools and sink parts. They cut the electrical supply, capped off the plumbing lines, unfastened the metal clamps, unscrewed all the pipes, and about an hour later, voila! The sink was lifted gently out of the countertop, with one guy holding the garbage disposal (which contained Rudy's head) up close to the sink (which contained Rudy's body). We laid the sink on its side, but even at this more favorable removal angle, Rudy stayed stuck.  Officer Tom's radio beeped, calling him away on some kind of real police business. As he was leaving, though, he had another good idea: ""You know,"" he said,  ""I don't think we can get him out while he's struggling so much. We need to get the cat sedated. If he were limp, we could slide him out."" And off he went, regretfully, a cat lover still worried about Rudy.  The remaining three of us decided that getting Rudy sedated was a good idea, but Bill and I were new to the area. We knew that the overnight emergency  veterinary clinic was only a few minutes away, but we didn't know exactly how to get there. ""I know where it is!"" declared Officer Mike. ""Follow me!""  So Mike got into his patrol car, Bill got into the drivers seat of our car, and I got into the back, carrying the kitchen sink, what was left of the garbage disposal, and Rudy.  It was now about 2:00 a.m. We followed Officer Mike for a few blocks when I decided to put my hand into the garbage disposal to pet Rudy's face, hoping I  could comfort him. Instead, my sweet, gentle bedfellow chomped down on my finger, hard, really hard and wouldn't let go. My scream reflex kicked into gear,  and I couldn't stop the noise. Bill slammed on the breaks, hollering ""What? What happened? Should I stop?"" checking us out in the rear view mirror.  ""No,"" I managed to get out between screams, ""just keep driving. Rudy's biting me, but we've got to get to the vet. Just go!""  Bill turned his attention back to the road, where Officer Mike took a turn we hadn't expected, and we followed. After a few minutes Rudy let go, and as I  stopped screaming, I looked up to discover that we were wandering aimlessly through an industrial park, in and out of empty parking lots, past little streets  that didn't look at all familiar. ""Where's he taking us?"" I asked. ""We should have been there ten minutes ago!""  Bill was as mystified as I was, but all we knew to do was follow the police car until, finally, he pulled into a church parking lot and we pulled up next to him.  As Bill rolled down the window to ask Mike ""where are we going?"" the cop, who was not Mike, rolled down his window and asked, ""Why are you following me?"" Once Bill and I recovered from our shock at having tailed the wrong cop car and the policeman from his pique at being stalked, led us quickly to the emergency vet, where Mike greeted us by holding open the door, exclaiming, ""Where were you guys?""  It was lucky that Mike got to the vets ahead of us, because we hadn't thought to call and warn them about what was coming. (Clearly, by this time we weren't  really thinking at all.) We brought in the kitchen sink containing Rudy and the garbage disposal containing his head, and the clinic staff was ready. They took his temperature (which was down 10-degrees) and his oxygen level (which was half of normal), and the vet declared: ""This cat is in serious shock. We've got to sedate him and get him out of there immediately.""  When I asked if it was OK to sedate a cat in shock, the vet said grimly, ""We don't have a choice."" With that, he injected the cat; Rudy went limp; and the vet  squeezed about half a tube of K-Y jelly onto the cat's neck and pulled him free.  Then the whole team jumped into code blue mode. (I know this from watching a lot of ER) They laid Rudy on a cart, where one person hooked up IV fluids, another  put little socks on his paws (""You'd be amazed how much heat they lose through their pads,"" she said), one covered him with hot water bottles and a blanket,  and another took a blow-dryer to warm up Rudy's now very gunky head. The fur on his head dried in stiff little spikes, making him look rather pathetically punk as he lay there, limp and motionless.  At this point they sent Bill, Mike, and me to sit in the waiting room while they tried to bring Rudy back to life. I told Mike he didn't have to stay, but he just stood there, shaking his head. ""I've never seen anything like this,"" he said again.  At about 3 AM, the vet came in to tell us that the prognosis was good for a full recovery. They needed to keep Rudy overnight to re-hydrate him and give him  something for the brain swelling they assumed he had, but if all went well, we could take him home the following night.  Just in time to hear the good news, Officer Tom rushed in, finished with his real police work and concerned about Rudy. I figured that once this ordeal was over  and Rudy was home safely, I would have to re-think my position on the police.  Bill and I got back home about 3:30. We hadn't unpacked from our trip, I was still intermittently dizzy, and I still hadn't prepared my 8:40 class. ""I need a vacation,"" I said, and while I called the office to leave a message canceling my class, Bill  made us a pitcher of martinis. I slept late the next day and then badgered the vet about Rudy's condition until he said that Rudy could come home later that day.  I was working on the suitcases when the phone rang. ""Hi, this is Steve Huskey from the Norristown Times-Herald,"" a voice told me. ""Listen, I was just going through the police blotter from last night.  Mostly it's the usual stuff: Breaking and entering, petty theft but there's this one item. Um, do you have a cat?"" So I told Steve the whole story, which interested him. A couple hours later he called back to  say that his editor was interested, too; did I have a picture of Rudy? The next day Rudy was front-page news, under the ridiculous headline Catch of the Day Lands Cat in Hot Water.  There were some noteworthy repercussions to the newspaper article. Mr. Huskey had somehow inferred that I called 911 because I thought Bill, my husband, was going into shock, although how he concluded this from my comment that his pads were turning blue, I don't quite understand. So the first thing I had to do was call Bill at work. Bill, who had worked tirelessly to free Rudy--and swear that I had been misquoted.  When I arrived at work myself, I was famous; people had been calling my secretary all morning to inquire about Rudy's health.  When I called our regular vet (whom I had met only once) to make a follow-up appointment for Rudy, the receptionist asked, ""Is this the famous Rudy's mother?"" When I brought my car in for routine maintenance a few days later, Dave, my mechanic, said, ""We read about your cat. Is he OK?"" When I called a tree surgeon about my dying red oak, he asked if I knew the person on that street whose cat had been in the garbage disposal.  And when I went to get my hair cut, the shampoo person told me the funny story her grandma had read in the paper, about a cat that got stuck in the garbage  disposal. Even today, over a year later, people ask about Rudy, whom a 9-year-old neighbor had always called the Adventure Cat because he used to climb on  the roof of her house and peer in the second-story window at her.  I don't know what the moral of this story is, but I do know that this adventure cost me $1100 in emergency vet bills, follow-up vet care, a new sink, new plumbing, new electrical wiring, and a new garbage disposal, one with a cover. The vet can no longer say he's seen everything but the kitchen sink. I wanted to thank Officers Tom and Mike by giving them gift certificates to the local hardware store, but was told that they couldn't accept gifts, that I would put them in a bad position if I tried. So I wrote a letter to the Police Chief praising their good deeds and sent  individual thank-you notes to Tom and Mike, complete with pictures of Rudy, so they could see what he looks like with his head on. And Rudy, whom we originally  got for free (or so we thought), still sleeps with me under the covers on cold nights and unaccountably, he still sometimes prowls the sink, hoping for fish...",clean

*Article misleads in support of Big Pharma*

Peerapan Tungsuwan and William McKay (Business Post, April 23)
misleadingly and incorrectly argue that Thailand's compulsory licensing
actions violate World Trade Organisation rules.

This comes as little surprise. The two work at the global law firm Baker
& McKenzie, which has a huge business representing Big Pharma. Among
Baker & McKenzie's clients is Abbott, the drug multinational attempting
to blackmail Thailand by withdrawing drugs it has submitted for
marketing approval in the country. Other clients include Aventis and
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer and Eli Lilly.

The lawyers' arguments do not pass the laugh test.

They argue that Thailand's action does not constitute ""public
non-commercial use"" because the compulsory licence permits the
Government Pharmaceutical Organisation (GPO), an arguably commercial
organisation, to use the patents. That is irrelevant. The licences are
for government use - distribution through the public health sector -
which is what matters.

The United States, for example, routinely issues ""public non-commercial
use"" licences in the defence sector to clearly commercial ventures (like
Boeing and Lockheed Martin).

They complain that Thailand's royalty rate is too low. They neglect to
mention that the patent holders are free to appeal the royalty rates,
but have in fact been uninterested in negotiating or litigating over
royalties.

And they contend that Thailand did not consider each licence on its own
merits. They ignore the reasoned basis that the Thai government has set
out for its decision in each case. They creatively interpret provisions
of WTO rules to suggest that governments must always enter negotiations
prior to issuing compulsory licences, despite explicit language to the
contrary - and despite common practice in the United States and
elsewhere, where government-use licences are issued with no prior
negotiations.

Peerapan Tungsuwan and William McKay aim to confuse readers by
misleadingly citing international law with which few non-specialists are
familiar. Had they disclosed their firm's ties to Big Pharma, everything
would have been much clearer.

BY Invitation

Compulsory drug licences violate world trade treaty


PEERAPAN TUNGSUWAN and WILLIAMMCKAY


We are familiar with the controversy that has been swirling around the
issue of compulsory licensing (CL) of patented pharmaceuticals in Thailand.


The Public Health Ministry has issued a white paper called ""10 Burning
Issues"", which is an apologia for CL. The ministry proclaims CL is ""a form
of social movement that aims at improving access to essential medicines and
the health of people"".


In spite of substantial increases in budget expenditure in other areas, the
ministry justifies CL by asserting that patented pharmaceuticals are too
expensive for the Thai budget. It proclaims that the ""public health
interest must come before commercial interests"".


With this line of reasoning, the ministry might just as well announce that
it will be compulsorily acquiring beds in private hospitals. Private beds
are undoubtedly too expensive. Such an action would also improve access and
place public health before commercial interests.


Perhaps sensing that it needs to find some additional rationale, the
ministry also asserts that its CL is in ""full compliance with the Thai
national and international framework"". In this context, this means in full
compliance with section 51 of the Thai Patents Act and Article 31 of the
World Trade Organisation's Agreement On Trade Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights (Trips).


In reality, we think the ministry has failed to comply with Trips in a
number of important respects. In this article we will explain why this is
so. In the next article, we will discuss what might be done about it.


First, we believe the ministry has failed to comply with Article 31(b) of
Trips because it did not have prior consultations with patent holders. In
our view, the CLs in favour of the Government Pharmaceutical Organisation
(GPO) are for commercial use, not for ""public non-commercial use"" as the
government claims and as required by Article 31 (b).


Second, the ministry has failed to comply with Article 31(h) of Trips
because the royalty rates stipulated (0.05% in every case) are not
""adequate"" and fail to take into account the ""economic value of the
authorisation"" (the CL).


And third and most important, the ministry has failed to comply with
Article 31(a) because it has not considered each case ""on its own merits"".


Let's discuss each of these failures in more detail:


Failure to Consult: Article 31(b) of Trips mandates prior consultations
with the patent holder except in cases of emergency or ""public
non-commercial use"". The ministry does not claim there is an emergency.
However, it does assert that the CLs in favour of the GPO are for a
""non-commercial purpose"".


We think the GPO's use of the CL will be for a commercial purpose. In fact,
Section 6(5) of the GPO Act states that the GPO carries on ""business"".
Sections 34 and 35 reinforce this basic objective.


For example, legislators envisaged the organisation making a surplus and
having an obligation to pay this surplus to the government. The GPO also
has joint ventures with private pharmaceutical companies. In the past, some
wanted the GPO privatised.


The GPO will be selling the products for which Thailand is issuing CLs. The
royalty obligations are expressed as a percentage of the GPO's ""sale
value"". In short, the activities are commercial, both in form and
substance. They do not cease to be such simply because the GPO is owned by
the government.


Contrary to what the Public Health Ministry asserts in its white paper,
Section 51 of the Patents Act is in fact silent on the issue of whether
there ought to be prior consultations with the patent holder. However,
Article 31(b) of Trips does say negotiations are required if the CL is
issued for commercial use, and we think the ministry has failed to comply.


Inadequate Royalty Rate: The royalty rate of 0.05% of the GPO's sales value
is not ""adequate"" and does take into account the ""economic value"" of the CL
as required by Article 31(h) of Trips. The sales value, and hence the
economic value, of each product varies. Prima facie, one would expect that
the royalty rates for each product should vary. But they do not. The rate
is the same for all three products.


There is some curious logic in the White Paper. The ministry asserts that
since the GPO will charge high retail prices for the products, royalty
rates paid to the patent holders should be low.


The opposite conclusion is more apt. If prices are high, royalty rates
ought also to be high to provide adequate compensation to the patent
holder. To make the royalty rate ""adequate"" within the meaning of Article
31(h), authorities should assess what rate might be applicable if this was
a voluntary licensing situation, not just a CL situation.


In our experience, rates in voluntary licensing situations would be much
higher, typically in the range of at least 5% to 7.5 %, and quite possibly
substantially more. In one recent case in South Africa, a 5% rate was
determined for an antiretroviral, and that involved a licence to settle a
competition dispute. In short, any adequate rate would be likely to be way
in excess of the derisory 0.05% stipulated by the ministry.


Failure to Consider Individual Merits: The ministry failed to comply with
Article 31(a) of Trips because it did not consider each case on ""its
individual merits"". This is the most basic and fundamental of all of the
ministry's failures to comply.


To consider any case on ""its individual merits"" by definition requires
prior consultations with the affected party. That party must be given the
opportunity to make its case and provide relevant evidence. These
principles resonate in provisions such as Article 41(3) of Trips, which
says: ""Decisions on the merits of the case shall be based only on evidence
in respect of which parties were offered the opportunity to be heard.""


In the case of every announcement of a CL, the ministry ignored these
principles. It deliberately decided not to hold prior consultations. It
seems the ministry had a preconceived view that any prior consultations
were unlikely to be productive as far as it was concerned.


By stipulating a blanket, uniform royalty rate of 0.05% for each product,
the ministry also failed to consider the individual merits of the products.
Had it done so and given the patent holders the opportunity to present
their cases, it may have realised each product and each CL is different,
and accordingly the rates ought to have been different and more adequate.


Trips is an international treaty to which Thailand is as signatory. Under
the new interim constitution, Thailand has an obligation to comply with its
obligations under international treaties, including Trips. We will explore
the legal implications of this obligation in our next article.

OK, I already uninstalled all free versions


There are good instructions here

I had a look at it. Looked pretty good but still uses nspluginwrapper which
gives me this error now:
# nspluginwrapper -i libflashplayer.so
/usr/lib/nspluginwrapper/i386/linux/npviewer.bin:
/usr/lib/nspluginwrapper/i386/linux/npviewer.bin: cannot execute binary file
/usr/lib/nspluginwrapper/i386/linux/npviewer.bin:
/usr/lib/nspluginwrapper/i386/linux/npviewer.bin: cannot execute binary file
nspluginwrapper: libflashplayer.so is not a valid NPAPI plugin

I used the provided packages though. Don't understand. If you got an
explanation or a solution ;), I'll take it.

Alexandre

"Louise,

I want to sign a confidentiality and exclusivity agreement with ABB with respect to our San Francisco T-Line Project.  There are no payment or service terms other than the concept that we are granting exclusivity to each other for two years. 

Reasons:
- I want to get some inexpensive resources from them to help us design and develop the project;
- I want to lock them up early since they are the clear industry leader and the puclic entities in CA may ultimately RFP.

My understanding is that approval is needed from you, John or Detmering.

Is this OK with you?

Regards,

Chris Calger

Subject:	Transmission Line Project-ABB Agreement

Re-sending with minor changes to the prior documents.  A clean copy is now provided.

Lance Schuler advised me that it is now Jeff Donahue, rather than Mark Metz, that needs to sign off on Corp's behalf, and that either Tim Detmering, Louise Kitchen or John Lavorato can approve on behalf of ENA.

  

A redraft of the ABB confidentiality/exclusive dealings agreement is attached for review and comment.

This document is based on the form ABB provided and for which ABB has expressed a strong preference.  

This draft calls for bilateral exclusivity for the Term (2 years).  As several of us have discussed, this will prevent ENA from choosing an alternative technology or supplier during that time should it choose to construct a DC transmission line within a 15-mile radius of San Francisco.  As I understand it, we are prepared to link arms with ABB to do this project because ABB is the premier supplier of this type of equipment. 

Based on recent discussions between Wayne and ABB, the language necessary for creating the exclusivity arrangement has been added to the form of confidentiality agreement that we had been working on with ABB earlier.  The added language is somewhat lengthy, but was necessary to establish the relationship and at the same time protect ENA against arguments that we are obligated to proceed with the potential transaction.  

Because this transaction does commit ENA to exclusivity obligations I understand that we will need to talk with Tim Detmering and Mark Metz about the transaction.  

Please let me know of comments.

That it probably needs to run as root.

Maybe there is an option when you start it up.

Should we not be able to use an object that implements 'invoke' as a
method of another object? There is some strange behaviour when I try
to.


.sub main :main
    $P0 = newclass 'Func'
    $P1 = newclass 'Obj'
    $P2 = new 'Obj'
    $P2.'some_method'()
.end

.namespace ['Func']

.sub invoke :vtable :method
    .param pmc an_arg

    print 'vtable invoke with self = ""'
    print self
    print '"", arg = ""'
    print an_arg
    say '""'
.end

.sub get_string :vtable
    .return ('an instance of Func')
.end

.namespace ['Obj']

.sub find_method :vtable :method
    .param string meth_name

    print 'find_method ""'
    print meth_name
    print '"" from ""'
    print self
    say '"" (***)'


    .local pmc func
    func = new 'Func'
    .return (func)
.end

.sub get_string :vtable
    .return ('an instance of Obj')
.end

=====

I expect as output:

find_method ""some_method"" from ""an instance of Obj"" (***)
vtable invoke with self = ""an instance of Func"", arg = ""an instance of Obj""

I don't know about the internals of parameter passing, it could be
that it's not possible.


The current output is:

find_method ""some_method"" from ""an instance of Obj"" (***)
vtable invoke with self = ""an instance of Func"", arg = """" (***)""

Some strange things are happening with registers.

Using ~/.local/ for user-managed content doesn't seem right to me at  
all, because it's hidden by default.

If user-local package installs went to ~/ by default (~/bin/ for  
scripts, ~/lib/python/ or ~/lib/pythonX.Y/ for modules and packages),  
with a way to set an alternate ""prefix"" instead of ~/ using a  
distutils configuration setting, I'd be happy enough.

I'd be even happier if there were no default per-user location, but a  
required configuration setting (in the existing distutils config  
locations) in order to enable per-user installation.

"Many exciting things have happened since I last emailed you about the Program.  Today, I will highlight the results of the recent Program Survey and discuss several initiatives we have underway.  I also want to invite each of you to attend one of four meetings we've scheduled to discuss the information below in greater detail, and to provide you with an opportunity for Q&A. Program Survey I want thank everyone who participated in the Program Survey a few weeks ago.  As promised,  I also want to communicate the results of the feedback you provided.  In short, we've made progress over the past 5 months in a number of areas, but there are still things that we can improve on.  Below are some summary points about the Survey, and how the results compare to the last Program Survey in October 2000. We surveyed all members of the Western Hemisphere Program, business unit supervisors and PRC reps, and summer interns.  Response rates of about 40% were consistent with last year. When asked about Overall Satisfaction with the Program, ""Favorable"" responses from Associates improved to 58% from 27%, and from Analysts improved to 46% from 41%.  ""Unfavorable"" responses also improved for both groups (Associates to 8% from 41% last year, and Analysts to 13% from 29%). Similar improvements were noted in the responses from the Business Units.  When asked about Overall Satisfaction with the Program, ""Favorable"" responses improved to 69% from 49%, and ""Unfavorable"" responses improved to 3% from 24%. Areas for Improvement most frequently mentioned included Rotation Management, Compensation, Performance Review Process, and Communication.  We have activities in progress to continue improvement in each of these areas. Initiatives   Below are some highlights of several things that will ""roll-out"" over the next few weeks, and many of them reflect your input to the Program through Survey feedback, as well as meetings that I've had with many of you. A new, online Rotation Information and Management System is in development and should be ready for delivery during the 4th quarter. Compensation packages have been revised for the current recruiting season.  An equity adjustment for current members of the Program is set for February 2002, several months ahead of the new class start dates.   We made significant changes to the PRC process at mid-year.  At this time we are working with HR on further improvements which will be implemented for the year-end process.  On the communication front several things are happening.  The Associate / Analyst Program newsletter will return later this month.  The format will be a concise email similar to the EnTouch newsletter used by Wholesale, and Global Flash in Europe.  A new external website for the Program was launched last week (access it via www.enron.com ).  A new internal website is expected to be operational by the end of September.  We are also planning eSpeak and Brown Bag sessions this fall to talk in greater detail about things like Recruiting, the PRC Process, and other topics of interest.  We will also continue the pizza lunch schedule. An updated social and community service activity schedule has been completed, and we are working on a more integrated approach to training and development for the Program.  Program Meetings I invite each of you to select and attend one of the meetings listed below, where I will discuss in greater detail the information I've highlighted above.  Each meeting will be held in EB 5C2, and will run from 7:30 to 8:30 am.  A continental breakfast will be provided.  Because space in this room is limited, pls rsvp to my assistant Maxine Levingston by the dates listed below.  Maxine can be reached by email at Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com . Friday, Sept 21   7:30-8:30 am   EB 5C2    (rsvp no later than 12:00 noon, Thursday Sept 20) Tuesday, Sept 25   7:30-8:30 am   EB 5C2   (rsvp no later than 12:00 noon, Monday Sept 24) Wednesday, Sept 26   7:30-8:30 am   EB 5C2   (rsvp no later than 12:00 noon, Tuesday Sept 25) Tuesday, Oct. 9     7:30-8:30 am EB 5C2 (rsvp no later than 12:00 noon, Monday, Oct. 8) I look forward to seeing each of you over the next few weeks.

Lisa,

This is the matrix I got from Judy Thorne on which GTCs to use.  Can you please double-check it and see if anything has changed?

Based on this, one-day deals will fall under a GTC Spot if we don't have a GISB in place with the producer.  In that instance, we don't need special handling in Sitara.

Hope this helps.  Please let me know what you find out from Gerald.

Gerald,

When you get a second, see if the following accurately captures which confirmation template should be used with which deals.

Confirmation Usage		
		
Form	Deal Type	
GTC Firm Pooled Gas	1 - 12 months Pooled Gas	
GTC Firm Point Gas	1 - 5 months Wellhead Gas	
Committed Reserves	Producer trades > 6 months	
GISB	Day-month trades not with Producers with GISB	
GTC Spot	Day-month trades not with Producers without GISB	

Thanks,
Judy

Slackware has the rpm tool available in distro so no need for any
script. If you're doing LFS then ""you're on your own"" it is not 
reasonable to expect people to make software ""LFS compatible"".
But then if you're into LFS then surely you can make whatever 
minor tweaks necessary to adapt, and that will be half the fun.
Slack and LFS are two of my fave distros. Less is more :)

I guess slackware users would need it too, in that case.

Senate Leader: Pres. Bush in �State of Denial� over Iraq
President Bush is in a ""state of denial"" over the war in Iraq and must listen to the majority of Americans who want U.S. combat troops to leave.  That�s what Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said today.  Reid laid out a Democratic plan for what he called a ""responsible, strategically driven redeployment"" of most American troops as part of a long-term strategy he said would have a better chance of leaving behind a stable, democratic Iraq than Bush's ongoing deployment of more soldiers and Marines.  He said Congress should give Iraqis ""tangible, measurable and achievable benchmarks"" to meet, and demand a regional conference with Iraq's neighbors to help settle the conflict.  Reid criticized a Friday speech in which the president asserted that despite last week's bloody wave of bombings, U.S. troops were making progress against the sectarian warfare that has plagued Baghdad and that ""the direction of the fight is beginning to shift.""  ""The White House transcript says the presi!
 dent made those remarks in the state of Michigan,"" Reid said. ""I believe he made them in the state of denial.""  Meanwhile, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Reid and his fellow Democrats are in denial about the impact of a U.S. withdrawal, which she said would amount to a ""defeat"" that would condemn millions of Iraqis to slaughter.  ""They are deluding themselves if they think that offering a surrender date is in the long-term strategic interest of this country,"" Perino said. And she said the ""talking points"" Reid derided are in fact ""principled stands.""

Virginia Tech Students Return to Campus, Classes after Massacre
""A lot of sadness, a lot of sorrow, a lot of silence,"" is how Tina Grimshaw, a shuttle bus driver, described the atmosphere on the Virginia Tech campus today.  A week after a massacre that changed their campus forever, students at Virginia Tech returned to classes.  An increased police presence -- described as visible but not overly dramatic -- is on the campus, where a shooting rampage claimed the lives of 32 students and faculty April 16. Mental health professionals wearing purple arm bands and faculty, staff and student volunteers wearing yellow ones marked with ""May I Help?"" are also available to assist the community.  But before classes began, many people attended a memorial service for the first two victims of the shootings -- Ryan Clark and Emily Hilscher.  Dozens of students gathered around the West Ambler Johnston dormitory, where the two were shot at that time a week ago.  Te school is being very liberal regarding students who don't show up. They're being given the!
  option of not returning for the remainder of this term and taking their present grades. There are no official numbers on how many are returning and how many have chosen not to.  But Grimshaw said some students were ready to get back to normal, though she thought that ""normal"" would take awhile to return. Others, she said, just want to finish the semester and go home.

Former Russian President Boris Yeltsin Dead
Former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, whose defiance of the 1991 Soviet coup attempt left him poised to lead a democratic Russia after the Soviet Union's collapse, has died at the age of 76, a Kremlin spokesman confirmed today.  His death was caused by sudden heart failure, medical sources told Interfax news agency.  Yeltsin resigned from office on Dec. 31, 1999 and appointed Vladimir Putin as president.  Since then, he's led a quiet life in a cottage outside of Moscow, appearing in public only for a few tennis tournaments.  Yeltsin's funeral will be held April 25, and a national day of mourning has been declared for that day, a statement from the Kremlin said.  Yeltsin became the first democratically elected president of Russia in 1991 and two months later put down a coup attempt against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.  One of the images most associated with Yeltsin is that of him sitting on a tank during the raucous street rallies that marked the coup attempt.

Minimum Wage Hike Inches Closer After Tax Break Agreement
Key leaders in the House and Senate have agreed to a package of tax breaks for small business that should ease the passage of the minimum wage bill.  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel of New York announced Friday that they had come to an agreement on tax breaks for small business totaling about $4.8 billion.  The Senate Finance Committee had originally proposed tax breaks of $12 billion while the House approved a smaller $1.3 billion package. The difference had been a stumbling block between the House and Senate, stopping them from sending a minimum wage increase to the president for his signature.

Some of the Fastest Thumbs in the Land
Next time you see someone typing out a text message, don't assume it's frivolous -- that could be a champion in training.  Right now many are congratulating 13-year-old Morgan Pozgar.  On Saturday, she was crowned the first ever National Texting Champion, and awarded $25,000 for her blazing thumbs.  300 competitors vied for the prize, being tested for both speed and accuracy.  Contestants were shown phrases on overhead plasma screens and asked to type them on their handsets exactly as they appeared without typos or abbreviations.  Pozgar's winning phrase was, ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocios! Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious. If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious.""  She had a text message speed of 42 seconds for a 151 character phrase, earning her the title and the cash.

Not in my experience.  However, it might be worth insisting on getting an
ethernet modem/router not a USB one so you won't have to deal with driver
issues.

It does double the price.  Having a line and paying rental is a
pre-requisite of getting aDSL.

Non-DSL options include NTL/Chorus, wireless broadband or perhaps 3G mobile
broadband.  They all seem to have their own gotchas but it has always
seemed to me that a service which runs over cables has an inherent
advantage over one which doesn't.

The problem is that people actually are trying to seriously help you,  but it is really difficult from your queries... Please specify what you expect to be your output - a vector where you  just paste the rows of of the original matrix one by one? If so, you can do d <- t(ht) dim(d) <- NULL or (a 'dirty' way) d <- c(t(ht)) It is not at all clear what your statement should do. For example, what  is length(ht) with ht being a matrix? For R it is the total number of  elements, but did you mean this or the number of rows/columns?? The suggestion to read R-Intro is the best advice you got here.

"Hi -

I'm a handy-board/ic newbie, so please excuse this question if it's answers 
seem obvious.  After two weeks of writing code in DOS/Windows (yuck), I 
downloaded the ic-2.860beta source code, which compiled without significant 
trouble in linux (redhat 5).  The version is, of course, a bit different from 
that which came with the handy-board (from Gleason Rsch, was version 2.851).

My question is, can I just copy the library files that came from Gleason Rsch. 
into the lib directory on the unix ic installation (it seems that I can, I 
just want to be sure)?  Are there any other issues I should be aware of 
(w.r.t. the beta, or using ic from unix, end-of-line conventions on library 
files, etc.).  I'm not particularly concerned with being able to download the 
pcode in unix - I do have DOS easily available...

BTW, thanks to all that have contributed to this really neat project - this is 
my first exposure to robotics, and it's been great fun so far.

"Gudday, Robin's reply obviously set something in motion in my brain, because I woke up with the answer on Saturday morning (which was actually pretty frustrating because I had to wait until Monday morning to try it out!) - essentially create a dummy array of 1s, and then use sweep to fill it out... Here's my code for the general solution... ### FnInflate ### ¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨ #Inflates an input array of arbitray size along the necessary dimensions to achieve the #same size as that in target.dim #balloon    :   array to be ""inflated"" #target.dim :   final size of ""balloon"".

Note that it will throw its hands up in the air if you try to inflate a (5,1,1) array to a (10,1,1) array - it will only work for, for example, inflating (5,1,1) to (5,10,10).

Yeah, but then I'd have to remember _exactly_ which confs I'd modified and

someone else to work on but the box he has available has only a P1 or P2
processor.  2. My celeron box has been crashing the backup software so I
wanted to try out the backup in a different box to make sure it's hardware
related.  Again, it's also an interesting exercise...

I'll be mirroring the disk but that is worth only so much (eg. lightning
strike taking out the disk(s) or system compromise)  I'm also going for a
backup to CDR with an automated restore http://www.mondorescue.org .  The
admin out there wouldn't be able to build the system again if the mobo got
fried and the replacement was the wrong arch but an i386 compatible
install will mean just dropping in the HD and booting (ish)...Conor

It's a hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil situation.  I don't personally 
know a *single* experienced Linux user who hasn't uninstalled or disabled it 
after figuring out that it's to blame for various problems (constant disk 
grinding, random cpu spikes, enormous cache directories, etc.).

What makes me mad are the uninformed people trying Linux who ""learn""  
that ""Linux"" has all these problems when it's really just one poorly behaved 
add-on.

"Hello,

I like to know, if exist anything as tempfile and
dialog program in Perl. 

Both commands is include in shell script.

I produce a software in shell-script that create new
databases in postgresql, define IP Address, Port
Number, set permissions, test versions, replace fields
and others. And all steps, i use dialog, for example
the user type a number port.

After know Perl, I decided make the same software in
Perl. I believe perl is a solution more powerfull,
than bash. But bash is fantastic too.  

With this maillist, I'm learning much.

Because of this a general statement like ""the allowable tons/year for SO2 in Harris County is ......."" would not be defendable or valid.   2)  I believe that the allowable data varies in relation to the season of year and part of the state - a.k.a., ""ambient background threshold"". In other words, if it is ozone season, allowable emissions probably would be lower.   3)  The allowable emissions threshold is also variable over time.  25 years ago, Harris county probably did not need an allowable cap for certain emissions.  As industry grows the allowable emissions will be adjusted.  The period of time for the data to become outdated could be as little as 1 month, depending on when new allowables or new permits are initiated.   4)  Texas charges corporations a ""tax"" for emissions over their allowable limit.  It is sort of a pay-as-you-go plan.  Of course I am being very simplistic here, but the point is still the same.   Your questions are excellent and I am giving you as specific an answer as possible.

At some earlier time in parrot history, there was a (32 bit, pointer-sized) 
'version' [1] structure item in pobj_t, which was active 
with !DISABLE_GC_DEBUG. The dummy was needed for i386 (when x86_64 didn't 
even exist) to align the data pointer at an 8-byte boundary.

The assembly coded mmx/sse copy subroutines were active at that time and did 
introduce a nice speedup.
These copy functions were used to copy register frames at - hmmm ancient - 
times before parrot got more than 32 registers.

As the past tense is indicating, above dummy is totally obsolete and the copy 
functions[2] are unused. The latter could be removed too, but might be a 
nice-to-have, when something faster than memcpy(3) is wanted or needed, 
albeit only on restricted (but common) platforms and for aligned memory only. 
Some recent CPUs do have special instructions for copying unaligned memory 
reegions too.

    $ svn log include/parrot/pobj.h | grep version

No, I don't think it is. People with Windows already have a SMB

That's odd, I recall my just-Samba 4 import into bzr was around 200 Mb
last I tried (but that's a while ago now).

Right. Shared repositories are just a storage optimization. They're
not a UI thing (yet). I've heard people talking about allowing you to
push repositories and all the branches in them at once, but haven't
seen any actual implementations.

Bazaar is working on getting better performance, it's just not there
yet. It will work with large trees in the future, just not yet. I also
don't think we should adopt it (even by truncating history) until it
can handle the larger histories.

Agreed.

OPEN SEASON

SG Resources Mississippi, L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of SGR 
Holdings, L.L.C., is conducting an open season for firm storage 
services at its new high-deliverability, salt cavern, natural gas 
storage facility, known as the Southern Pines Energy Center. The open 
season will begin at 9:00 a.m. CDT on February 4, 2002, and will 
continue until 5:00 p.m. CDT on March 4, 2002. The project is located 
at the border of Mississippi and Alabama with access to the major

Crude Oil Futures Rally on IEA Report


    Crude oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.62 to 
$20.26 per barrel on Friday as speculators and small traders covered 
short positions ahead of the weekend. The market softened last week 
after a report by the EIA of a 2.4 million barrel rise in crude 
stocks as refineries cut production due to poor margins. The latest 
report from the IEA gave the market a boost by indicating that OPEC, 
excluding Iraq, exported 640,000 bpd less of oil last month than in 
December. The IEA pegged production by the 10 cartel members with 
quotas at 23 million bpd, still well above their 21.7 million bpd 
limit. Even though OPEC's cut is less than half of their promised 
curbs, non-OPEC producers only trimmed exports by a third of their 
promised reductions. The IEA says that there are opposing forces at 
work in the oil market, while OPEC and others are lowering exports, 
refiners are cutting runs, reducing demand and largely offsetting the 
export reductions. Reports that Kuwait's state oil refiner would 
shutdown its 200,000 bpd Shuaiba refinery for 7-10 days due a 
mechanical problem helped lift prices. Heating oil for March delivery 
on the NYMEX climbed $0.014 to $0.5334 per gallon. March gasoline 
futures on the NYMEX rose $0.018 to $0.5877 per gallon. In London, 
Brent crude oil futures for March delivery on the IPE were up $0.51 
to $19.72 per barrel.

Hunt Oil Commissions Study for Camisea LNG Project

    A subsidiary of Hunt Oil, Camisea LNG, has selected Kellogg Brown 
& Root, a division of the Halliburton, to conduct a Front End 
Engineering Design study for a LNG liquefaction facility and marine 
terminal on the coast of Peru south of Lima. The $8.5 million study 
is expected to be complete in about 8 months. The facility will be 
near the Camisea natural gas field, which is estimated to contain 13 
Tcf.  Development of the field and construction of a pipeline and 
related facilities to deliver gas to Lima are currently underway and 
are expected to be completed in 2004. If the plant is constructed, 
Peru would become the first country in South America to export LNG, 
with shipments expected by the last quarter of 2006. The FEED 
contract will include studies from the inlet to the LNG facility, 
through the liquefaction process, to the marine LNG loading facility. 
The design study contemplates a one-train liquefaction plant with a 
total production capacity of at least 545 MMcf of gas per day. 
Kellogg Brown & Root will also study and engineer plans for a 
dehydration facility, an acid gas removal facility, and other 
necessary infrastructure. Concurrent with the FEED contract, 
environmental impact assessment for the Camisea LNG export project 
will be conducted.

Williams Cuts Deliveries on Pipeline

    Williams says it has cut deliveries in its oil products pipeline 
in the Midwest through the end of February and then will re-evaluate 
the situation. Sharply lowered demand for diesel fuel and gasoline 
have led to a supply glut in the Midwest, despite cutbacks in 
refinery runs. Current low prices make it more economically feasible 
to store the products rather than take them out of storage. As a 
result, there is danger of a backup of gasoline and diesel fuel 
supplies in the Gulf Coast region. Williams would not provide 
specific figures on the volumes being cut on its 9,000 miles of 
pipeline that includes 39 terminals in 11 states. In 2001, the 
Williams Pipe Line system moved an average of about 740,000 bpd. 
Currently, there is about 6.8 million barrels in storage, out of a 7 
million barrel capacity for 87 octane gasoline in the Williams 
system. Williams' diesel fuel capacity is about 4.5 million barrels, 
and for the past 2 weeks Williams has carried more than 5 million 
barrels in the system. As summer approaches, the pressure is on for 
Williams to turn around its gasoline stocks. The winter-grade 
gasoline is now in the tanks. The oversupply will make it more 
difficult this year for Williams to turn over the product in time for 
summer-grade gasoline, which must be at terminals by May 1st.

Senate Seeks to Increase Vehicle Fuel Standards

    Democrats in the Senate have introduced legislation to raise 
vehicle fuel efficiency standards and close a loophole that allows 
SUVs to get lower gasoline mileage than cars. The bill, which aims to 
reduce dependence on foreign oil by cutting back on gasoline use, 
would require the vehicle fleet to average 35 miles per gallon by 
2013, up from the current 24 mpg. Currently, the Corporate Average 
Fuel Economy standards require passenger cars to average 27.5 mpg, 
while sport-utility vehicles, along with mini-vans and other vehicles 
in the light truck category, need get only 20.7 mpg. The proposed 
legislation would slowly increase the fuel efficiency of both cars 
and light trucks. The CAFE standards would increase to 33.2 mpg for 
cars and 26.2 mpg for light trucks by 2010, and then jump to 38.3 mpg 
for cars and 32 mpg for light trucks in 2013. The legislation would 
combine the passenger car and light truck categories beginning with 
the 2010 model year. However, heavy-duty pickup trucks are not 
included. Gasoline demand accounts for 45% of the 19.8 million 
barrels of oil that is consumed daily in the American market. Half of 
that oil is imported. Raising the fuel standard would save 2.6 
million bpd by 2020. Republicans have come up with a competing CAFE 
plan that would require an average fuel economy for fleet of 36 mpg 
by 2016. Higher fuel requirements would be phased in beginning with 
the 2007 model year. That bill would combine light trucks and SUVs 
with passenger cars when calculating the fleet's fuel economy, 
thereby eliminating the SUV loophole. It would also allow auto makers 
to trade greenhouse gas emission credits with other industries to 
help meet the higher CAFE requirements. Auto makers say a significant 
boost in mileage requirements would force them to make more 
expensive, light-weight vehicles that they claim would be less safe. 
Whichever CAFE standard the Senate Committee approves will be 
included in a broad energy bill the Senate will begin debating this 
week. However, higher fuel requirements might not make it beyond the 
Senate floor if the parties are not able to resolve differences over 
both the CAFE standard and drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge. The Senate will also have to work out differences on energy 
policy with the House of Representatives. The House passed its own 
version of a broad energy bill last August that would allow drilling 
in ANWR and increase the vehicle mileage requirements only slightly.

Shell to Rebrand Newly Acquired Stations


    In one of the largest rebranding efforts ever undertaken in the 
US, Shell plans to spend about $500 million to replace the Texaco 
name with its own logo on thousands of gasoline stations it acquired 
from ChevronTexaco. The Texaco stations will be given a new look, 
similar to those of Shell's European stations and about 9,000 current 
Shell stations in the US will also be given a facelift to match. 
ChevronTexaco sold the stations to Shell after the FTC required it to 
divest the stations and other assets in order to gain approval for 
its merger. Shell says it may either close or sell 10%-30% of the 
retail outlets it acquired in the deal and could trim about 15% of 
jobs at those stations. The acquisitions will give Shell over 20,000

"KEI Policy Blogs: New KEI research note on Patent Pools
Source: http://www.keionline.org/index.php?option=com_jd-wp&Itemid=39
Post: June 6th, 2007 by Judit Rius Sanjuan

KEI has published a new research note on patent pools. This is a survey
of 35 different existing and proposed patent pools, covering different
technologies and time periods, beginning in the nineteen century through
the present.

Patent pools have been widely used to achieve a number of different
objectives, including some that were anticompetitive, and others that
improved social welfare. As the title of the research note indicates,
the research shows a variety of purposes and management structures.
There is no single reason for creating a patent pool, and no single way
to manage a patent pool.

The Research Note is available on html and pdf formats here:

Political Hot Topics
(Today's top political stories from news organizations across the country)

""THE IMPACT IS FELT IN EVERY CLASSROOM"": President Bush said Monday that the mass shooting at Virginia Tech, the
deadliest campus shooting ever in this country, affects every student across the nation. ""Schools should be places of
safety, sanctuary and learning,"" Bush said in reaction to the deaths of more than 30 people on the campus. ""When that
sanctuary is violated, the impact is felt in every American classroom in every American community."" Bush spoke with
Gov. Timothy M. Kaine and Virginia Tech President Charles Steger. ""I told them that Laura and I and many across our
nation are praying for the victims and all the members of university community that have been devastated by this
terrible tragedy,"" Bush said in the Diplomatic Room of the White House. AP via Yahoo! News: Bush says shootings affect
all students http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070417/ap_on_go_pr_wh/bush_virginia_tech

INCIDENT REVIVES GUN CONTROL DEBATE: Monday's deadly rampage at Virginia Tech sparked a largely one-sided response in
the long-running debate over guns. Gun control advocates said the shootings pointed to the need for tougher laws, while
supporters of gun rights generally kept their heads down. And leaders of both major political parties expressed
sympathy for victims and their families, while avoiding comment on gun control. In brief remarks from the White House,
President Bush expressed the nation's grief over the carnage in Blacksburg, Va... Bush, a longtime champion of the
right to bear arms, said nothing about the gun control debate. Similarly, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada
and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco expressed sorrow about the shootings but remained silent on gun
control. Los Angeles Times: Gun control debate resumes, on one side
http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-gunlaw17apr17,1,2333005.story

A ""RADIOACTIVE"" ISSUE FOR DEMS: Democrats have grown very reluctant to talk about gun control. It has become a
radioactive issue. And a Republican who once was an ardent supporter of it, Rudy Giuliani, now says he supports the
right of individuals to bear arms and that the states not the federal government should decide how to control guns.
After Gore's defeat, Terry McAuliffe, then chairman of the Democratic Party, was vocal in advising Democrats to abandon
gun control as an issue in future elections. ""I believe we ought to move it out, let the individual communities decide
their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated,"" he said. ""It has had a devastating impact on elections because the
NRA has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members' views and Al Gore's views."" The Politico:
Shootings Echo Across Decades Without Gun Control Solutions http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0407/3533.html

""CHILLING EFFECT"" ON CAMPAIGNS: The chilling effect of the Virginia Tech shootings reverberated yesterday from the
late-night comics to presidential hopefuls. Jay Leno led into his ""Tonight"" show monologue with what sounded almost
like an apology for doing jokes after the worst shooting massacre in U.S. history. ""Our job has always been to kind of
end your day, get a few laughs, so that is what we will try to do,"" Leno said. ""I just want to be respectful. We will
do some jokes, we will be silly. But we just want - we don't want to forget what happened today."" Clearly wary of
offending voters, several presidential candidates hurriedly canceled plans to campaign today out of respect for the
Virginia Tech shooting victims. New York Daily News: Campaigns - and comics - feel chill
http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime_file/2007/04/17/2007-04-17_campaigns__and_comics__feel_chill.html

HOUSE, SENATE NEGOTIATORS HAMMER OUT DETAILS ON SPENDING BILL: Congress and the White House will move this week toward
a final showdown over a contested war funding bill, with most Americans trusting Democrats over President Bush to set
Iraq policy but with sentiment deeply divided over Congress's push to set a deadline for withdrawing U.S. forces.
Democratic leaders will formally convene House and Senate negotiators tomorrow to hammer out a final version of the
bill, hoping to have the compromise on Bush's desk by the end of next week. The president and Democratic leaders again
exchanged verbal fire yesterday. Bush used a backdrop of military families to declare: ""We should not legislate defeat
in this vital war."" Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), flanked by retired Army generals, fired back: ""The
president and the vice president continue to desperately cling to their failed escalation strategy and attack those who
disagree with them."" Washington Post: Final War Funding Bill in Works
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/16/AR2007041601099.html

SENATORS TO HOLD HEARING ON EAVESDROPPING BILL: FBI agents and other federal investigators would have greater leeway to
eavesdrop on foreigners in the USA suspected of having information on terrorism or national security threats, under a
Bush administration proposal. The bill has the backing of the Justice Department and Director of National Intelligence
Mike McConnell. It would allow the telephone calls, e-mails and other activities of persons who are not U.S. citizens
or legal residents to be secretly monitored if they are thought to ""possess significant foreign intelligence
information."" Individuals and groups who deal in ""weapons of mass destruction"" would also become surveillance targets,
under the proposed law. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act requires that a surveillance target be an agent of a
foreign power or connected to a terrorist group before a secret FISA court authorizes monitoring. The proposed law, a
copy of which was furnished to USA TODAY by McConnell's office, would amend that requirement. USA Today: Surveillance
bill gets Hill hearing http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-04-16-FISA_N.htm

DOCS SAY NJ GOV ""RECOVERING BETTER THAN THEY HAD EXPECTED"": Surgeons operated on Gov. Jon Corzine yesterday for the
third time since he was critically injured in a Parkway crash, and said he might soon eat, talk and breathe on his own.
In their most detailed explanation yet of Corzine's condition, Cooper University Hospital doctors said the governor was
recovering better than they had expected and that they hoped to begin weaning him off medication that has left him
barely conscious since Thursday. But they cautioned that the extensive injuries to his leg, chest and back made any
predictions dicey. ""I don't say patients are out of the woods until they leave the hospital,"" said Steven Ross, head of
the hospital's trauma unit. ""He's certainly not out of the woods yet."" Newark Star-Ledger: MDs say Corzine healing
better than they expected http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/index.ssf?/base/news-11/1176786570251210.xml&coll=1

DEMS HAVE NEARLY TWICE AS MANY DONORS: From Congress to the presidential campaign, Republican fundraising is lagging
while Democratic donations are surging. Yet beneath the record-breaking million-dollar totals lies another statistic
that could be more ominous in 2008 for Republicans: a yawning gap between the presidential primary fields' donor bases.
According to campaign figures, the Democrats' top three candidates received donations from about 204,000 individuals.
The first-tier Republican trio drew checks from 110,000, roughly half as many. That donor disparity helped give the
Democrats a big first-quarter financial advantage. The Democrats' top three candidates reported having $61 million in
cash at the end of the quarter, compared with $29 million posted by the top Republicans. Of the nine presidential
hopefuls who raised more than $1 million, six are Democrats, compared with three Republicans. The Politico: GOP Funk:
Top Dems Have Twice As Many Donors http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0407/3538.html

Q1 NUMBERS CONTRADICT PREVIOUS ASSUMPTIONS: The first-quarter fundraising reports from the 2008 presidential campaign
crystallized two realities of this intensely fought election: The battle for each party's nomination is more open than
it was just three months ago, and each contest pits three relatively well-funded candidates against one another, with
the rest of the field at a disadvantage. Two common assumptions proved false: that Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.),
with the most extensive money network in Democratic politics, would blow away her rivals in first-quarter fundraising,
and that Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), who had spent the previous two years preparing for this campaign, would easily best
his Republican rivals. Instead, Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) stunned political observers by raising more money for the
primudles than Clinton, and McCain's anemic fundraising and rapid spending left the onetime front-runner on the
defensive. Washington Post: Fundraising Totals Challenge Early Campaign Assumptions
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/16/AR2007041601705.html

WHO'S THE KING OF WALL STREET? Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama ran ahead of New York Senator Hillary
Clinton and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani on their home turf, raising cash from the biggest investment banks on
Wall Street. Obama raised $479,209 from employees at the banks in the first quarter, according to Federal Election
Commission filings. That was better than Giuliani, a Republican who collected $473,442. Clinton, Obama's Democratic
rival, raised $447,625. The figures are based on employers listed by donors; in some cases, the names are missing or
incomplete.  The employees of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG gave Obama more than a combined $260,000, boosting
his showing. The Illinois senator's top fundraisers include David Heller, a managing director at Goldman, and Robert
Wolf, chief executive officer of UBS Americas. Bloomberg: Obama Gets Edge on New Yorkers Clinton, Giuliani on Wall
Street http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=aLeZ7ht_LtZg

HOW THEY ARE SPENDING: [E]ach campaign doled out its contributions differently, often in unexpected ways that provide
some insights into the candidates. Mitt Romney, the Republican, who is by far the richest candidate, was stingiest with
his staff members' salaries, often having them fly discount airlines and stay in accommodations as humble as a Super 8
Motel in Parsippany, N.J. Senator John McCain of Arizona, whose Republican primary campaign spent the highest
percentage of income during the quarter, paid nearly $11,000 for photography, $1,700 for decorations and $1,671 for
flowers. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, who irked donors during her last Senate campaign by running up
heavy bills for such amenities, spent just $205 for photographs and $89 for flowers, according to the campaign's
filings. But her campaign did report a debt of $1,995 to Jack H. Lucky Floral Design in New Market, Va. New York Times:

EDWARDS GETS A $400 HAIRCUT: Democratic White House hopeful John Edwards insists on first-class pampering - enjoying
$400 haircuts on the road and plunking down nearly $500 for swank spa treatments, according to campaign records.
Edwards, who touts himself as the poor man's champion and even launched his bid from New Orleans' hurricane-devastated

HEF'S ON THE HIL BANDWAGON: Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) is seeking to become the first woman president, and a
man who has published countless pictures of naked women is pitching in for her White House bid. Hugh Hefner, the
founder of the Playboy Enterprises empire, is among the many celebrities who have picked their favorite candidate to
succeed President Bush in 2009.  Hefner contributed $2,300 (the maximum allowed in the primary) to Clinton's campaign
on March 28, identifying his occupation on the fundraiser form as ""editor-in-chief"" of Playboy magazine. The Hill: Hugh
Hefner gives $2,300 to Clinton's '08 campaign

McCAIN CALLS FOR ""GREATER FISCAL RESTRAINT"": Senator John McCain of Arizona acknowledged Monday that his fellow
Republicans ""forgot who we were"" in recent years by spending too much, and said that as president he would rely on low
taxes, greater fiscal restraint and free trade to lift the nation's economy. Mr. McCain, whose presidential campaign
has been viewed with suspicion by some conservatives because of his initial opposition to the Bush administration's tax
cuts, used the first major economic address of his campaign to reaffirm his commitment to the free market but said he
would move to overhaul the nation's unemployment programs to help people find jobs in the new economy. And he had some
strong words for the way his fellow Republicans governed when they controlled Congress. New York Times: McCain Says
Fellow Republicans Spent Too Much While Running Congress http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/17/us/politics/17mccain.html

OBAMAS EARNED $991K IN '06: The annual income for Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and his wife dropped about $680,000 in
2006 from the nearly $1.7 million they took in the prior year, according to documents released Monday. Information
released by the Chicago Democrat's presidential campaign indicated that the Obamas' total income decreased because in
2005 they had a major book deal and a one-time bonus. Their 2006 income of $991,296 included Obama's salary of $157,082
and his wife's administrator's pay of $273,618 from the University of Chicago Hospitals and $51,200 in director fees
from a food distributor, TreeHouse Inc. AP via Yahoo! News: Obamas' 2006 income put at $991,296

CLINTON NO LONGER ""VERY MUCH RIGHT"" ON ""VILLAGE,"" SAYS ROMNEY: Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney says that Sen. Hillary
Rodham Clinton is wrong when she contends that ""it takes a village"" to raise a child, though he told a newspaper in
1998 that Clinton was ""very much right.""... During a speech to New Hampshire Republicans last weekend in which he
touted the need for strong American families, the former Massachusetts governor said, ""I think it's time for us to
recognize every child deserves a mother and a father."" Asked by The Associated Press after the speech if he disagreed
with Clinton's view, expressed in her 1996 book ""It Takes a Village,"" that raising children requires a community-wide
effort, Romney said he disagreed and added, ""It takes a family."" However, in 1998, Romney told The Boston Globe:
""Hillary Clinton is very much right, it does take a village, and we are a village and we need to work together in a
non-skeptical, no-finger-pointing way."" AP via Yahoo! News: Romney changes view on 'village' comment

Getting the error that 'another suspend is already in progress'  indicates a bug in TuxOnIce - we're taking a lock and somehow not  releasing it on an error path. I'll add that to my todo list. The error in 'Going Atomic' is probably because you need to increase the  allowance we make for drivers allocating memory during the atomic copy.  Assuming you're using the hibernate script, this is done by editing  /etc/hibernate/suspend2.conf. If you cat /sys/power/tuxonice/debug_info  after an attempt at hibernating, the last line will say something like: - Extra pages: 1069/500. This means that 1069 pages were needed, but we only allowed for 500. In  that case, you'd want to add something along the lines of procsetting extra_pages_allowance 2000 to /etc/hibernate/suspend2.conf.

I'm not very familiar with grep) snip That is mostly correct.  You are using the grep function in scalar context, so it will return the number of items matched rather than the items themselves. You need a join to make it work the way it was intended.  Also, you don't use a comma after the block and the backticks should be terminated (which is why I like qx// better, it is easier to see) my $var = join '', grep { /This|That/ } qx(cmd --arg1 --arg2 2>/dev/null); On a related note, my solution implements an egrep -v rather than an egrep.  It should have been my $var = ''; while (<$out>) {    next unless /This|That/;    $var .= $_; } --  Chas.

I'm not very familiar with grep) Actually, I very quickly saw what I was doing was silly. I moved to somethi= ng a little different for that portion: my $var =3D `cmd -arg`; if ($var =3D~ /(expr0|expr1|expr2|expr3)/) {         Do stuff; } This seemed to work! I was able to reuse the code for the other scenarios w= hile only executing the system call once which was actually a lengthy resou= rce intensive op. Probably a million other *and* better ways :) Thanks for the help guys! jlc --anodpocnjgcdginpdpff Content-Type: message/rfc822 Content-Disposition: inline; filename=""beginners_98856.ezm"" >From wwsddj@telus.net  Sun Feb 24 10:31:25 2008 Message-ID: <47BCCA94.8000009@telus.net> Date: Wed, 20 Feb 2008 16:49:24 -0800 From: ""John W.

"Attention:

It is my pleasure to contact you for assistance and
business co-operation. I know the content of this
letter might be surprising to you but I assure you
that every word of it is true. Even though we hardly
know each other I believe you can help me.
.
I am Dr. Rilwanu lukman,President Adviser on Petroleum
and Energy and Alternate Chairman of N.N.P.C
Board&also OPEC President Designate.My office monitors
the sales and lifting of crude oil and petroleum
product by foreign dealers. With the cooperation of my
assistant and head of the audit committee attached to
the task force, I have successfully saved about
US$37.5 million.
This money is as a result of allocation of excess
crude oil to the foreign dealers, which has been sold
but this money is not entered in the financial
statement of my task force. This money was lying
unclaimed in the account of the task force, known only
to me and the chief security officer in our ministry
who help me in
moving
the fund out through his security network and me
involved in the excess
allocation.
However, the legislators of the new democratic
Government of my country have set up a panel to look
into the past activities of some government companies
and parastatals. I do not want the panel to discover
the money I saved.
I cannot lodge this money into my private bank
account. In my country, public servants are not
permitted to operate any account in excess of $500,000
US Dollars. Now the idea is to have a foreign partner
whom the sum will be transferred to. I  have concluded
arrangement and transfered this money to a finance
company for safekeeping to avoid the government from
seizing this fund .
All you have to do is to give me  your private
address,
phone and fax lines and . I will
send you the details of the transfer and necessary
document as soon as you provide them.
If you can assist me transfer this money into your
nominated bank account,I will give you 20% of the
amount. You will keep the remaining sum for my wife
pending
her arrival to your country. We intend to invest 50%
of the sum in business. With your knowledge and past
experience your advice will be highly needed for the
investment. We would want to know the lucrative
business areas in your country we can invest on with
the 50% of the sum.
Don't worry about any problem in this business. I
assure it is safe and no risk is involved. No other
party is aware of the sum from the excess allocation
except my partner and me. However, this transaction
should be secret and confidential.
I awaits your reply on your participation or not, so
that I can search for another willing person. Your
quick response matters.
 
Best regards
 
Dr. Lukman Rilwanu

Forecasting Significant  Increases in Market Share; Sales Projections for Next 12 Months Now Surpasses  $20 Million   3/23 GDVI:    Global  Diversified Industries, Inc.

Announces Six Month Revenues Top $4  Million 11/07    GDVI: Announces $2.1M in School District Contracts 9/21      >>>>>>>> Overview  >>>>>>>>    Global Diversified Industries operates in the modular building  construction industry, and strategically targets the California Education  Sector. GDVI is strategically located in Central California on 16 acres with a  100,000 square foot state-of-the-art manufacturing facility.    Throughout 2003 the company focused on building its infrastructure through  acquisitions, development of a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, and by  securing the requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth.    Through the combination of its new facility, the increased demand for  portable buildings and the State Of California's bond approvals, GDVI has become  well positioned to become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing  on the west coast.    GDVI should benefit greatly from the $12.1 Billion school improvement bond  that is expected to be passed by California voters next month (March). This  presents, in our opinion an opportunity for early investors of GDVI to also  benefit before the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and  subsequently invests in those companies.    Global Diversified has taken numerous strategic development steps  throughout 2003, including generating strong revenues as well as profits and is  now poised for explosive growth in 2004. The company is led by a strong  management team with previous success in building companies into $50 million per  annum businesses.    In the past year GDVI has exceeded its own sales revenue projections,  renewed its piggyback contract, received state approvals on engineered product  designs, started a new credit facility and opened its new 100,000 square foot  manufacturing facility. The company will continue to seek new acquisition  candidates through its aggressive growth plan.    >>>>>>> Profile  >>>>>>>    GDVI is a holding company that currently operates three wholly owned  subsidiaries, Lutrex Enterprises, Inc., an entity which holds equipment and  inventory for the registrant, MBS Construction Inc., a modular contractor  specializing in modular construction site work and renovation and Global  Modular, Inc., a sales, marketing and manufacturing of modular type structures.    Its principal customer base is currently educational (public and private  schools, universities, etc.), child-care and municipality sectors. Its product  lines consist of a variety of portable classroom designs, including both  single-story and two- story floor plans. Global Modular's portable classroom  structures are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre-approved  building plans, commonly referred to as ""P.C.'s"" or ""pre-checked"" plans, that  conform to structural and seismic safety specifications administered by the  California Department of State Architects (DSA).    Global Modular also enjoys the benefit of providing educational customers  with products contracted under a ""piggyback clause"". The State of California  allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular classroom vendors  under a bidding process where the successful bidder can provide other public  school districts and municipalities portable classrooms under a ""piggyback  contract"" issued by the originating school district. This process saves school  districts valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids.    A modular vendor who possesses a ""piggyback contract"" containing  competitive pricing and a variety of design options may have access to future  business for up to five years, depending on the term of the piggyback contract.    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  The Strategic Focus on California Schools  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>    Since 1998, California legislation has required that at least 20% of  all new classrooms constructed with State funds be portable structures.    There are five compelling reasons for this trend:    Modular classrooms are FASTER to construct (as quickly as 2 weeks) They  cost significantly less (as low as $30,000 vs. $100,000) They offer greater  flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings    They are easier to finance They provide financing incentives         To cope with population growth, the State Department of Education estimates  that California will need more than 2,500 classrooms each year for the next four  years, which equates to more than 10,000 classrooms.    Due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout the California  Education Sector, public and private schools are expected to turn to  portable/modular construction to fulfill their additional classroom requirements  over the next four years.    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  The California Schools Budget Crisis  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>    On November 5, 2002 a $13.2 billion School Facilities Improvements bond  proposal (Proposition 47) was passed by California voters.    This bond measure passage does not include an approximate $9.4 billion  worth of local bond measures passed by various school districts throughout the  state.    A second bond measure worth $12.1 billion will go before the voters on the  March 2004 ballot, which is expected to pass.    These bond measures are about three times higher than the record $9.2  billion bond California voters approved in 1998. The revenue generated from  these bond measures will be used for school modernization programs, which  include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular classroom  construction and renovations.    Money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and private schools;  design upgrades and expand building space at community colleges and other  institutions of higher learning throughout California.        >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  GDVI Business Infrastructure  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>    Among Global Modular's asset base is its integrated, state-of-the- art,  automated manufacturing process which includes equipment, raw material and  marketing collateral that are specifically designed for the high capacity  fabrication of modular structures.    GDVI employs a workforce of 60 employees and is looking to add to its  workforce as demand increases.    Operates out of a sixteen acre site with a 100,000 square foot operating  structure.    Wholly owned subsidiary (Lutrex Enterprises) owns the equipment and assets  involved in the manufacturing process    Wholly owned subsidiary (Global Modular Inc.) markets, designs and  manufactures the buildings    Wholly owned subsidiary (MBS Corporation) handles installation and building  renovation.    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  GDVI Manufacturing Infrastructure  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>    GDVI has created a turnkey manufacturing process with experienced  professionals handling every aspect of each manufacturing project. Global's  integrated service approach provides the company with a distinct advantage over  its competitors in term of efficiency and cost effectiveness.    Via 3 wholly owned subsidiaries, GDVI delivers the following in-house  services:    Design, Engineering and Planning Site Preparation Manufacturing and  Construction Delivery, Installation, and Relocation Ancillary Interior  and Exterior Services Customer Service and Support      ------------------------------------------------ Disclaimer    TRI-STATE Capital feature stock reports are intended to be stock ideas, NOT  recommendations.

I got:

>>> print(""あ"")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File """", line 1, in 
  File """", line 3, in write
UnicodeEncodeError: 'latin-1' codec can't encode character 'あ'

Your hack doesn't work. Displayhook hack doesn't work, too.

Question: Are you happy if you are forced to live with these hacks forever?
If not, why do you think I'll accept your suggestion?

   Many USB gamepads have four or more buttons.  Timing on them is usually 
superior to KBs and there's certainly much less variability from one to the 
next than there is between one KB and the next.  USB 2.0 gamepads stand a 
distinct change of having millisecond accurate timing but I've yet to get 
the chance to benchmark one.

>If keyboard is the only possibility for four buttons, how can I make errors
>as small as possible?

   You would have to have a method of measuring the error and even then 
you'd have to keep on trying different KBs until you found a good one.  I 
was pleasantly surprised to find that a new one the other day that someone 
needed for testing that only had a SD of 4.5 ms.

>Is there any way of knowing the range of errors?

   You have build something that presses keys at exact an interval, then 
you can use testmode 8 to benchmark a keyboard.  But most people don't have 
the wherewithal to build crystal controlled oscillators driving a solenoid...

Log:
After Jeremy has given is ack on irc:

Change rename_internals to open the file/directory and then call
rename_internals_fsp. Two reasons: Remove code duplication and remove a
race condition. The race condition was due to the fact that in
can_rename the share mode check closed the file and then after that did
the rename.

"since lisa used fuchsia , i ' ll use lavender . .
on # 1 i would eliminate that processing . in addition , can we delete / hide / not access old paths that haven ' t been used in gas production in lets say a year or so . would this help performance ? this would also force the schedulers to path / think about the way they are pathing their transactions and not rely on old paths that may no longer be accurate ! ! we ' ve seen old bad , zero paths be re - used accidentally .
on # 2 , the scheduling position window is the weakest link . . . . . goodbye !
on # 3 , contract reference i know is used alot in the supply and market list . nomlogic is also slated to use these contract reference fields for comments . do we need it in the inventory list ? probably not as much as the supply and market list but i still believe it ' s necessary for pools and imbalance accounts .
on # 4 , we use this functionality alot on cgas , tenn , trco and sab . . . when we path one to many or many to one in "" chunks , "" it does seem to go faster than one path at a time .
on # 5 , brokered paths could really just be slammed in there . no need for the extra processing that occurs for service contracts .

subject : path manager rewrite / optimization project
importance : high
all :
we ' re currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed . going foward , i would like bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers / schedulers . we had this approach with nomlogic and having clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely . who ever you choose , we would need about 15 % of their time for now . later on , with coordination efforts and testing , it may go up to 75 % . i don ' t see that happening for a while though .
the sooner we get someone to devote to this , the better off we will be . i expect these changes that we ' ll be looking into should improve performance quite a bit .
that being said , we ' ve identified three items that would speed up processing the retrieval of path manager .
1 ) currently , the path manager attempts to reuse path ids . i can ' t think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step ? it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn ' t find a match . i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can ' t think of a valid reason for performing this work . i talked with dave nommensen , and according to him , what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place ? ? ? from a scheduling perspective , my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it . if you were overpathed , you ' d see it in the path manager either way . [ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this .
2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system "" autonoms "" so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ?
3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools .
4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process .
5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard .",clean

"Dear friend,  RE save our soul    I am Mrs. Deborah Kabila, one of the wives of Late  President Laurent D. Kabila of Democratic Republic of  Congo (DRC).  Consequent upon the assassination of my husband, I am  in possession of USD 58,000,000 (Fifty Eight Million  US Dollars Only) being funds earlier earmarked for  special projects.  This fund has since been deposited  in a security company in West African Country of Togo  where I am residing now with my children. It is now my intention to move the said fund out of  this place (Togo) to a safer place for the benefit of  my children and I, for immediate investment.  Based on  this that I solicited for your assistance to enable me  take this money out of Togo.  However, note that my children and I have agreed to give you 20% of the total fund if you can accept the  offer of assisting us.  Also it will be your  responsibility in directing us on a viable business.  It is also my intention to relocate and probably take  a temporarily resident in your country pending when  all the troubles in my country will be resolved. We  advised that you look for a house we will buy as soon  as we arrived.  To conclude this transaction, you will be required to  come to Togo to open an account in any bank here in  Togo where the security company will deposit the total  sum in your favor. From this bank the money will be  remitted into your original bank in your country.  Immediately this done, all of us will depart Togo to  your country, where my children and I are expected to  take a temporary resident.  Please note that I can not open any Bank account with  my name because, My late husband's first  son-JOSEPH-who took over power in our country, don't  want to see me and my children, He claimed that when  our husband was alive, that I was very close to him  than any other of his wives including his (Joseph)  mother. He also claimed that because of my closeness  to him that I was able to get things from him more  than others. As a result he has been monitoring me.  Infact this one of the main reasons I want to take my children out of our country and any nearby country.  Thanking you in advance.

"Hi all,
 
The mirror has been running for the past month with a more redundant RAID configuration (on expense of storage area, of course :( ).
 
1. The IPv6 addresses will be either removed or utilized by the end of this week.
2. The non-US directories were synced from ftp://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/, using the official anonftpsync script. Should I use another upstream server to sync from?

OK. I get :

The following entries were submitted: Submission-Type: new

Site: mirror.isoc.org.il

CDImage-http: /pub/debian-cd/

A proper project/trace directory was not found on the HTTP server.

The error message returned was: 404 Not Found

If you don't understand this error message, please contact us.

Entry not submitted!

Although http://mirror.isoc.org.il/pub/debian/project/trace/ is there.
And I tried to access it from gluck.d.o and it went fine. Could you check?

"Dear ilug@linux.ie 

Life Partners are life insurance appraisers that appraise all types of life insurance policies, allowing people to access their life insurance cash now rather than later. We help individuals unlock cash from unutilized assets. 
Individuals usually age 65 or older who find that their health, financial and/or estate planning needs have changed are typical candidates. We have had some candidates advised by financial planners to drop their life insurance policies so they could invest their money in a vehicle that will make them a return now. DO NOT drop your policy as it may be worth CASH to you NOW.

Why do people sell their policies? 
The reasons individuals make the decision to sell their life insurance policies are as varied as the people themselves. Some reasons may be to:

Pay off debts 
Fund long term care insurance cost 
Eliminate costly premiums 
Take advantage of other financial opportunities 
Make charitable contributions 
Help family members

"URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85409355
Date: Not suppliedBlake blogs[1] about how mpt[2] wants Mozilla to look just like MSIE. I have to 
admit, the evidence is pretty compelling. I recall someone asking me, ""Do you 
really agree with mpt's Top 10 list? He's quoted you at the top of the list!""Do I agree that those ten items mpt mentions are the top ten problems? Of 
course not. No two people will have the same top ten problems. Also keep in 
mind that mpt and I can agree that something is a problem without necessarily 
agreeing on the solution to the problem. Maybe we have different ideas 
regarding how to solve a particular issue, but we at least both believe it is 
an issue that needs to be addressed. That's something.To cover the list specifically:
- Navigator chrome structure - While I don't necessarily agree with mpt's 
proposed default configuration, I do agree that the chrome structure is 
painfully restrictive, and that customizable toolbars need to be implemented in 
order for us to acquire the flexibility to deal with this problem.- Speed - can't argue with this, except to say that cutting out a lot of the 
useless UI and features from the chrome helps substantially. Reduce bloat, gain 
speed.- Text editing - if you use Chimera on the Mac, you'll see that the textfield 
widget is easily the most painful part of the entire application. It's buggy, 
slow, misbehaves, and doesn't edit the way you'd expect. This is IMO Chimera's 
top usability problem.- Message display - Yes. No argument here.- Search - Yeah, it's a mess. Don't know if it would be in my top ten, but it's 
a mess.- Menu structure - This gets back to my blog about how the apps should be 
separated. The menu structure has been complicated in order to deal with 
multiple applications. A clean separation naturally simplifies the menus (e.g., 
you can eliminate the New submenu easily).- Migration - A problem, but IMO not one of the top ten facing Mozilla.- Context menus - mpt complains about two-click context menus, and yet, the OS 
default on Win32 (overwhelmingly) is to bring up a context menu on a mouse up. 
If you don't like it, complain about Win32, but don't cite this as a Mozilla 
usability problem when we're following the conventions of the operating system. 
(We simply listen for the WM_CONTEXTMENU message. That message fires when Win32 
wants to fire it.)- Validation - Err, no. Not a usability problem. To the average bear, this is 
completely irrelevant.- Preferences - IMO this should be much higher on the list. Preferences are a 
tangled pathetic mess. Again, separating prefs for individual apps into unique 
dialogs would simplify things a great deal, but we should also remove nearly 
half the preferences that exist from the GUI. Mozilla is ridiculously 
overconfigurable.[1] http://www.blakeross.com/archives/2002_08_18_index.html#80418641

Works for me with the same setup. I stuck a time.sleep into the
test function to simulate the slowness of your network. Might make
a difference, I suppose. Couple of tangential points:

1) If you're on a slow connection anyway, don't have the double-whammy
of checking the file's existence and then fetching its version info. Just go
for the version info and catch the exception. CAVEAT: The exception seems
to be identical for a non-existent file and a file with no version info.

2) [This may just be because this is self-contained sample code]
You're generally going to be better of using a Queue or something
suitably locked sharing mechanism to get info to and from a thread.

I can't see anything else obvious. Do you see the same behaviour with
a local drive and a faked delay, eg time.sleep (5)? If not then it might
be that the various levels of your network setup are conspiring to block
the process. Not really sure there. If that does prove to be a showstopper,
you might consider the  processing module which is plug-compatible with
threading but uses processes instead. Bit of a sledgehammer to crack a
nut, maybe but...

I will check the languages directory, but this confuses me - do people

New Revision: 23696

WebSVN: http://websvn.samba.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?view=rev&root=samba&rev=23696

Log:

added the create mask and related share permissions options to Samba4,
using the new share_int_option() code from Simo

speaking of which, this is the first time I've looked closely at the
share_classic.c code. It is absolutely and completely braindead and
broken. Whatever drugs Simo was on at the time, he better not try to
cross a border with them on him!

Problems with it:

 - if you actually set a value, it gets ignored, and the defvalue gets
   used instead ('ret' is never returned). If you don't set a value,
   then defvalue gets returned too. Sound useful?

 - it means we now have to list parameters in source/param/ in lots
   and lots of places, all of which have to match exactly. code like
   this is supposed to reduce the likelyhood of errors, not increase
   it!

 - code which has a long line of if() statements with strcmp() should
   cause your fingers to burn on the keyboard when you type it
   in. That's what structure lists are for. Strangely enough, we have
   all the info in loadparm.c in a structure list, but instead it gets
   replicated in share_classic.c in this strange if() strcmp() form

expect some changes to this code shortly. I'll need a calming cup of
tea first though :-)

"Now, I recieved two good answers for my problems.

1) Built an H-Bridge
2) Use the LMD18200

Now has any one any documentation on an easy H bridge that I could build

without wasting much time?
The same goes for the LMD18200, I understand that is not compatible with

the HB, has any one built a small circuit which would interface the HB
and LMD18200

Oh yeah, one more thing, how about connecting a 5 ohm resistor in series

with a DC motor and there are 2 amps flowing, then the resistor is
dissipating 20 watts of heat.

Now I could have a higher value for the resistor, like 7, 10 ohms, I
think that could do it too!

Is this an easier way???

I've got a few quick Lockergnome-related notes for you today.

First, we'd really like to see you in August. I know that Jake, Chris and
Randy have been signing off on their newsletters with those few words, and
I'll join them. If you didn't experience Gnomedex last year, you missed, in
the words of many industry insiders, ""The show of the year."" It was unlike any
other computer conference I've ever attended. Unlike any conference I've
attended, period, computer-related or not. While most such conferences are a
huge hustle and hassle, Gnomedex was what computing and Lockergnome are all
about - sharing useful information, gathering with like-minded enthusiasts,
and learning to use your chosen computer to the fullest extent. No hustle. No
hassle. No BS. For the minimal cost of registration, it would be hard to find
a better weekend for geeks and wannabes alike. Add to that the schedule of
luminaries presenting and attending and you've got the best deal on the planet
for computer users. It's hard to believe we're less than a month away - I
really do hope to see you there.

Another Lockergnome innovation has hit the newsstands - err, bookstores.
That's right. Jake has release a **FREE** GnomeTome on ""Converting Vinyl LPs
to CD."" Who'd have thought there were so many of you out there that are, well,
my age and still in possession of those black slabs of aural heaven. I don't
know if Jake's just lost his mind, or what, but free? Get outta here. Go ahead
- ""Gnome"" our servers. Get you copy while you can. And while you're there,
check out some of the other killer e-tip books in the GnomeTomes collection.

Have a great Tuesday.

**Setting the Home Page in Konqueror**

Konqueror, while a great browser, has taken a step in the direction of IE.
Like IE, Konqueror is really an integrated web _and_ file browser. You can use
it equally well to view web pages and files on your system. It's been
something of a hot debate whether this is actually the proper use of a
browser. In fact, Galeon was written specifically to answer this question -
it's a web browser and a web broswer only.

Regardless, it can be a bit annoying to punch the Home button on the Konqueror
browser and end up in your /home/ _user_ directory. Have no fear, though. It's
an easy change to make your actual web home page the home page in Konqueror.

Open Konqueror and select Settings from the toolbar. Select ""Configure
Konqueror,"" and leave the default selection of ""File Manager"" as is. In the
text box on the right half of the screen, you'll see a tilde in the ""Home URL""
text box. That just tells Konqueror to use the user's home directory as the
home URL. Changing this to a web address will set that address as your home
page. Select OK to close the window.

Taking it one step further, click on the Home button in your Konqueror browser
to open your newly-configured web home page. Then, select ""Window"" and ""Save
View Profile, 'Web Browsing.'"" This will futher save the URL and allow your
the opportunity to save the window size when the browser opens.

Konqueror is more than just a web browser. But, it's not so tough to make it
act like a pure web browser if you just know where to look.

**Kernel Configuration - Part XII**

Depending on who you talk to, RAID can stand for ""Redundant Array of
Independent Discs"" or ""Redundant Array of Inexpensive Discs."" No matter. They
both point to the same theory and practice in Linux; data storage redundancy.
That's today's kernel configuration section - Multi-Device Support.

Let's talk first about the principles behind a RAID setup. RAID uses multiple
discs for speed, increased data storage, or data redundancy. Fundamentally,
there are 5 levels of RAID in Linux; Linear, RAID-0, RAID-1, RAID-4, and
RAID-5.

Linear RAID uses two or more discs, appending data from one to another. In
other words, when disc 1 is full, disc 2 steps in to store data. There is no
redundancy in Linear RAID - only an increase in storage capacity. Further,
there's no marked increase in data access speed because you're accessing one
drive in the RAID array at a time.

RAID-0 ""stripes"" data across the RAID drives. Some data will be written to the
first drive, some to the second, etc. Like Linear RAID, RAID-0 provides no
redundancy. Because the data has been written in parallel across the drives,
not all data exists on all drives. Lose a drive and your data is gone. RAID-0
will, however, decrease data access time. Your system will run more quickly.

RAID-1, unlike Linear and RAID-0, _does_ provide data redundancy. This is the
first level in which data is ""mirrored"" across the drives in the RAID array.
All data that exists on one drive exists on all the others. RAID-1 requires at
least two drives and they should be of equal size, otherwise, your overall
RAID array will be the size of the smallest drive. Performance with RAID-1 can
actually be slower than with a single drive or RAID-0, as all the data is
written across multiple discs.

RAID-4 is, for the most part, pretty useless. It reserves one disc for parity
information while striping the data across the others. This is much like
Linear mode, with an additional disc thrown in for parity data. Parity data
_can_ be used to reconstruct and retrieve the data on the other drives, but
this really isn't a redundant method of data storage. Consequently, RAID-4 is
probably the least used of the RAID schemes.

RAID-5 is designed for 3 or more discs and provides both redundancy and speed.
Like RAID-4, RAID-5 pays close attention to parity data. However, rather than
reserving a device in the RAID array for this data, it's written across the
array. Because the parity data is written across the array, data recovery can
be accomplished fairly quickly. In fact, using a ""spare disc"" configuration
will allow RAID-5 to reconstruct the data to the spare disc immediately after
the failure of a drive. Because of it's increased speed and redundancy, RAID-5
is probably the most common setup for multiple storage devices.

With all that in mind, you'll need to make a choice in your kernel
configuration. Do you have mutliple drives of the same size that you'd like to
configure as a RAID array? The Multi-Device Support section of the kernel
configuration will allow you to do this. In fact, you'll be able to set the
RAID level, as well. Again, evaluate your needs and select the appropriate
option.

Tomorrow, it's on to networking options in your kernel configuration.

**Windows Apps in Linux?**  
Scribbled by Robert Nix

""Nice coverage but I don't give a flip about Office. OpenOffice is fine for my
needs.

""What I really want is to run Quicken (at least v.2001) which is the only app
keeping me running Windows (using vmware). I've tried Quicken on Mac OS X and
it is grossly inadequate and on Linux with Wine and have so far been
unsuccessful even using tips from
http://appdb.codeweavers.com/appview.php?appId=107. I hope that GnuCash will
eventually support the online features I enjoy but that doesn't help now.

""The reason I'm writing this is that I personally think Office products are
overrated for home users, at least now that there are several native
alternatives. For home users, finance apps are the key issue now. Do a section
on getting Quicken to run in Wine and I'll declare you a god. :)""

**Important Unix Manpages**

http://home.ins.de/~m.hussmann/man/

Manpages are an important part of Linux use. Armed with the proper knowledge
and manpage, there are few sticky situations in Linux that can't be solved
quickly. Though they can be a bit cryptic at times, manpages are really a
Linux newbie's best friend.

Important Unix Manpages is a compilation of help for situations that actually
have little to do with programming. They're more human interface problems than
machine interface problems. This page just points out that if life was like
Linux, we'd all be a lot happier.

With the binary from the virtualbox site, you simply install the rpm and
it takes care of the kernel and everything else. You only have to run
the module loader once and once after each kernel change.

As an added ""bonus,"" I am now including a list hosts that are vulnerable  from a daily scan which I am conducting. There is also a summary so that we  can all  track the progress of reducing UCSB's exposure to this  vulnerability. Here is what you need to do if your host is in the list: 1. Make sure that the host has been completely cleaned up. Unless the host  is completely rebuilt, please make sure that the host is not running any  rogue IRC bots, FTP servers, VNC, etc. Tools like ""tcpview"" and ""procexp""  from www.sysinternals.com should help to locate any such services. 2. Send an email message to security@ucsb.edu to inform us that the host is now safe to be connected with the internet. When referring to multiple IP addresses, please list the IP addresses on separate lines. 3. If you find any rogue services running, please include the type of  service and the port that it was using. Now, here are the lists ... *** Filtered Hosts *** 128.111.103.21  otter.opl.ucsb.edu 128.111.104.155 euphrates.geog.ucsb.edu 128.111.106.101 olympia.geog.ucsb.edu 128.111.106.121 slave.geog.ucsb.edu 128.111.106.15  zulu2.geog.ucsb.edu 128.111.106.163 alexlaptop.geog.ucsb.edu 128.111.108.108 host108-108.lsdepts.ucsb.edu 128.111.108.128 host108-128.lsdepts.ucsb.edu 128.111.108.158 host108-158.lsdepts.ucsb.edu 128.111.108.193 host108-193.lsdepts.ucsb.edu 128.111.108.219 host108-219.lsdepts.ucsb.edu 128.111.108.54  host108-54.lsdepts.ucsb.edu 128.111.111.97  superman.bren.ucsb.edu 128.111.120.25  ip25.lmri.ucsb.edu 128.111.126.68 128.111.126.69 128.111.138.160 128.111.138.171 128.111.138.174 128.111.164.209 turtle.mee.ucsb.edu 128.111.165.27  host165-27.lsdepts.ucsb.edu 128.111.181.188 R181188.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.182.190 R182190.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.182.224 R182224.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.182.234 R182234.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.182.235 R182235.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.182.241 R182241.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.182.246 R182246.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.182.248 R182248.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.183.166 R183166.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.185.27  adriatic.ece.ucsb.edu 128.111.221.19  odissi.mat.ucsb.edu 128.111.221.26  igertpc.mat.ucsb.edu 128.111.229.251 128.111.229.252 128.111.247.62 128.111.247.63 128.111.248.143 SN248143.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.248.149 SN248149.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.248.169 SN248169.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.248.191 SN248191.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.248.9   SN2489.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.29.20   meppc1.engr.ucsb.edu 128.111.30.173 128.111.34.65   pfrws-1.engr.ucsb.edu 128.111.35.220  ecipc045.engr.ucsb.edu 128.111.37.189  SR37189.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.37.250  SR37250.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.38.194  SR38194.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.38.214  SR38214.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.58.177  delhi.ece.ucsb.edu 128.111.72.160  ugl10.mee.ucsb.edu 128.111.74.158  nakamuralab8.materials.ucsb.edu 128.111.74.249 128.111.75.244  MZ75244.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.75.248  MZ75248.resnet.ucsb.edu 128.111.77.36   luna.crss.ucsb.edu 128.111.77.77   genetest.crss.ucsb.edu 128.111.77.79   superlady.crss.ucsb.edu 128.111.77.82   theomac.crss.ucsb.edu 128.111.78.195  host78-195.lsdepts.ucsb.edu 128.111.79.35   sediment.mee.ucsb.edu 128.111.82.129  calimero.chemengr.ucsb.edu 128.111.82.13   joshtest.chemengr.ucsb.edu 128.111.82.132  seppia.chemengr.ucsb.edu 128.111.82.133  codavinci.chemengr.ucsb.edu 128.111.82.14   connerjs.chemengr.ucsb.edu 128.111.83.134  cobra.chemengr.ucsb.edu 128.111.83.137  krait.chemengr.ucsb.edu 128.111.83.242  marina.chemengr.ucsb.edu 128.111.83.43   dh83043.chemengr.ucsb.edu 128.111.9.125   orb125.itp.ucsb.edu 128.111.9.126   orb126.itp.ucsb.edu 128.111.9.211   dhcp211.itp.ucsb.edu 128.111.9.230   dhcp230.itp.ucsb.edu 128.111.9.241   dhcp241.itp.ucsb.edu 128.111.94.30   host94-30.lsdepts.ucsb.edu 128.111.97.19   pubfloor4-002.library.ucsb.edu *** Unpatched hosts *** 128.111.102.10  RPCSS Vulnerable -

    Could you combine fusion and fission to produce a continuos reaction?

               VERSION may be either a numeric argument such as 5.006, which

Summary: Add notification sound to Outlook addin

Initial Comment:
This patch adds support for playing notification sounds 
when messages are processed by SpamBayes.  The 
attached ZIP file contains 3 diff files to patch files in the 
Outlook2000 directory, and a 
notification_sound_patch.txt file that describes the 
notification sound feature and how to configure it.

Looks like time to do a little cleanup.  This has been fully implemented
for awhile in 1.1 including configuration in the SpamBayes Manager dialog.

I've checked the changes into latest CVS.  The next step
will be to provide a Notifications tab in SpamBayes Manager
for configuring the sounds.  Until then, you can configure
it according to the original instructions in this patch. 
The only difference is that I placed the settings in a
separate section called ""Notification"" instead of in the
""Experimental"" section.

Kenny - how would you feel about committing this to CVS Head
at some point?  We still get regular requests for it, and I
don't see that it could hurt going into 1.1a1.

Hmm.  There are a *lot* of experimental/new features that 
will be present in the next release that weren't in 1.0a7 as a 
result of dumping the 1_0_release branch and the current 
popularity of 'x-' options.  I suppose these don't effect the 
plug-in in any obvious way, but they are still there in the 
background (apart from the web interface changes).

I agree that we shouldn't be adding any new features, 
especially experimental ones, to the 1.0 release.  A branch 
sounds like a good idea, and fits with the branching strategy 
discussed earlier on spambayes-dev.  Either a single branch 
for all new features or a separate branch per feature is fine 
with me.

I'm reluctant to include this in the trunk at this stage. 
How would you feel about it going on a branch, and after 1.0
we integrate it?  If we are really keen, we could build
""experimental"" binaries for people as we go (but these would
not be official)

2^31-1 for each (in a data frame, that number of elements for a matrix).

Yeah, you could always run away, strangle your wife, your wife could

Yeah, I happen to live in a small hole, under the roots of an old oak

So thought I, but apparently all it favours is a lot of whining about good
old times, the inability of youngn's to pay for your pension and the
health insurance, and the generic influx of uncouth furriners, which must 
be stopped, Somehow.

But then I'd have to figure out how to use perlmonks myself.  I imagine I

I've attached my fix.  Essentially, the problem turns out to be that 
stderr and stdout can arrive in any order.  One can be completed before 
the other is even available.  Hence we just have to wait for both of them.

Yes, it does (I've checked with a ""pseudo-user"" who receives
r-help in digests in MIME format). 
So you can indeed do the following.

In my limited experience, the main problem is the bad quality of
people'e e-mail software which does not properly work with
the (typically invisible) 'References:' and 'In-Reply-To:'
headers which mailman indeed does preserve in its MIME-digests.

    TH> If it does, then your reply could
    TH> include an ""In-Reply-To:"" which identifies the

    TH> As to (1), you will probably get several suggestions for

    TH> AllStat digest in a window with ""attachment"" tags
    TH> displayed, one for ""Tablf of Contents"", one for each
    TH> message. Clicking on one of these opens a new window
    TH> with the message attached to that tag displayed, and now
    TH> the usual reply/forward etc mail sunctions can be
    TH> applied to that message.  But it will reply only to the
    TH> address given in the ""From:"" header (i.e. the original
    TH> sender, as above), not to the AllStat list (so you have
    TH> to enter that address by hand, if you want to reply to
    TH> the list).

    TH> In principle, mailer software could also identify the
    TH> address of the list from which the digest has been sent,
    TH> as well as the sender of the original message, so you
    TH> could get the option to reply to either or both. But my
    TH> XFMail does not, and only offers the original
    TH> sender. Whether other mailer software can do this is for
    TH> others to comment on!

    TH> Hoping this helps, Ted.

"HOMELAND SECURITY INVESTMENTS


The terror attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001 have 
changed 
the security landscape for the foreseeable future. Both physical and 
logical 
security have become paramount for all industry segments, especially in 
the 
banking, national resource and government sectors.  According to Giga, 
a 
wholly owned subsidiary of Forrester Research, worldwide demand for 
information security products and services is set to eclipse $46B by 
2005.

Homeland Security Investments is a newsletter dedicated to providing 
our 
readers with information pertaining to investment opportunities in this 
lucrative sector.  As we know, events related to homeland security 
happen 
with lightning speed.  What we as investors can do is position 
ourseEBASSes in 
such a way as to take advantage of the current trends and be ready to 
capitalize on events which have yet to happen.  Homeland Security 
Investments is here to help our readers do just that.



With this in mind, it is with great excitement that we present Vinoble, 
Inc. 
This stock is expected to do big things in both the near and long 
terms.

***Why we believe VNBL.OB will give big returns on investment***


* At this time much of VNBL's focus is on RFID (Radio frequency 
identification) technology.  This is technology which uses tiny sensors 
to 
transmit information about a person or object wirelessly.

* VNBL is already an industry pioneer in the RFID Personal Location 
Technology.

* VNBL is developing a form of RFID technology which allows companies 
and 
governments to wirelessly track their assets and resources.  Such 
technology 
has HUGE potential in the protection and transportation of materials 
designated ""High Risk"" were they to fall into the wrong hands.

* VNBL works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order 
to 
create ""High Security Space"" in locales where it is deemed necessary.  
Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea 
ports, 
mines, nuclear facilities, and more.

* As with all stocks, news drives the short term price. Fresh news has 
made  VNBL a hot buy.


NEWS ON VNBL


MALIBU, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2005--Vinoble, Inc. 
(OTCBB:VNBL - 
News), a holding company seeking to identify long-term growth 
opportunities 
in the areas of homeland security, security information systems, and 
other 
security services, announced today that it plans to offer products and 
services that will assist in the automation of the identification and 
control of equipment, assets, tools, and the related processes used in 
the 
Oil & Gas and Petrochemical industries.

Although small wirelessly networked RFID sensors can monitor machines 
and 
equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious, they 
can 
also deliver safety features within oil wells. Oil maybe trapped in 
different layers of rock, along with gas and water. Detection of 
specific 
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise 
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur, 
such as 
a well filling with water.

As with other RF based technology applications, RFID can also provide 
the 
safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler, and limit the 
entry of personnel to specific locations. Ensuring personnel safety is 
essential, should there be an emergency at a facility, RFID tags would 
enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee's safety and/or 
danger. This application technology requires product and hardware that 
can 
operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions, but gives 
valuable 
safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer. RFID 
can 
also assist the customer's supply chain by tracking oil, gas, and 
chemical 
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level.

Vinoble's viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are 
more 
than just a valuable tool to the mining industry, but as a protective 
measure of our country's natural resources and commodities against 
threat. 
Preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of 
U.S. 
industry and economy.

The Company believes that such offering service and technology 
application 
in the Oil & Gas and Petrochemical industry will further position 
Vinoble in 
a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the 
increasing capital and global spending that the Company will require 
for 
growth. The Company's goal is to also provide a much-needed service at 
a 
cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can't afford to 
do 
without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of 
constant threat.


This is Outstanding news.  The growth potential for this company is 
exceptional.  In an already hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a truly 
innovative pioneer.  We see big things happening to this stock.

"hi stinson , as per our discussion , which we will expand upon when we meet
later today , my currently role in hamachi is better characterize as
combination of deal support ( from the engineering perpsective ) , facilitating
my work with jean mrha ( via erik simpson ) on the initial load forecast and
general requirements document development . none of this is technical by any
means . if anything , it is more like engineering consulting ( from deal
perspective ) by ebs research to john ' s group . i will bring it up with john
tomorrow night about bringing our technical guys on such road trips so that
they can get involved with his group even though no optimization modeling
work may need to be done . for this i will use samer and / or chonawee but we
need to be certain that they are available on such on - call basis as stated
below . john is very clear and specific about who he ask to be at such
meeting and when , etc . normally he does not want any deviations . so if we
put someone on such jobs , they have to be able to travel on - call anywhere ,
any place . that is the time pressure he is working with .
he want me to be the primary contact for such deal support effort . but i will
ask to bring along our technical guys on such trips so that they are plugged
in etc . . .
i will recommend this to john for the next deal that he is planning .

"moderators ' message a very happy 1995 to all our subscribers ! as you can see , linguist is back on line - - on the 8th , not the 5th as we had hoped , but we are now up and running at our new address . remember : those of you who post to linguist @ tamvm1 . tamu . edu can continue to use that address . but those of you who used to post to linguist @ tamsun . tamu . edu must change either to the . . . tamvm1 address or to linguist @ tam2000 . tamu . edu the latter is our new editorial address . the . . . tamsun address is now worse than useless : the machine itself has been taken off line by texas a&m , so any messages sent there will simply disappear into an internet black hole . they will not be forwarded to us . the new year 's issues start with this issue : 6 . 1 . however , the listserv swallowed some of the issues we posted on dec . 20 and is just now sending them out . so you probably received some issues of volume 5 ( 1994 ) only today . this is not what we intended - - indeed , we worked hard to clear the mailer and post all the messages we had received before we shut down on dec 21 . we realize that some of them had deadlines . however , listserv malfunctions are simply not within our control . the texas a&m sysop took a long ( well-deserved ) ( and , we hope , energizing ) christmas vacation . and , until his return , the listserv would not free the issues we had posted . and that , by a lightening transition , brings us to a few remarks on maintaining free discussion on linguist . as linguist grows , it becomes potentially more powerful - - some might say "" threatening "" - - by virtue of its role as an information source . it 's natural that controversial policies and postings should generate concern ; and last year we received a number of complaints , protests , and editorial suggestions . we tried to respond to every message individually ; but we 'd also like to publicly explain our policies and our current thinking about some of the issues that arose . if any of you care to respond , we can continue this discusson on linguist . * we received several requests that we check the accuracy of controversial claims and allegations before we post them . however reasonable this sounds , unfortunately it simply is n't possible . linguist processes 50-70 messages a day ; last year we assembled and posted 1600 issues ( as those of you with overfull mailboxes know ! ) ; and we get over 1000 database requests a week , about 1 / 4 of which require some kind of administrative interchange . we ask our 3 student editors to check messages for civility ( more on this below ) ; but they do n't have time to check anything which is not immediately before them on the screen . so there is no way that we can strive for the standards of accuracy of paper journals . and , of course , we aren ' t a journal ; we ' re a discussion list . the only effective check on the accuracy of any posting is the discussion itself . so the moral is : - - read with a little scepticism - - and , if you see an inaccuracy , post a correction * the preceding applies , of course , to _ professional _ content in postings ; we can't be responsible for the accuracy of anyone 's claims about the number of words for "" snow . "" nor - - and this is the problematic area - - can we check claims about anyone 's or any institution 's decisions , opinions , or conduct . we will make every effort to ensure that any such posting has professional relevance , is temperate in phrasing , and ( if at all possible ) does not mention names . we also try not to publicize controversies having only personal relevance , since we do n't want linguist to become simply a forum for private grievances . but more than that we can't do . * about more widespread grievances : we have gotten many protests about cutting off discussions that criticize specific schools of linguistics . our problem with some of these has been that the criticisms were anecdotal , ( sometimes ) devoid of academic content , and sounded personally aggrieved ( see above ) . also , adherents of the schools under attack were telling us they no longer felt welcome on the list . so - - not wanting linguist to become a grievance forum or a cause of unnecessary divisiveness in the discipline - - we cut off the discussions . but we admit that there are good arguments on the side of free speech . so we have decided at least not to cut off discussions abruptly . instead , we will warn "" next - to-last posting on x "" before we send out a "" last posting "" message . and we will post any responses on x received in the interim . also , we 'd like to reiterate that any discussion that could compare schools or theories and stick to the academic issues would be very welcome . we are not committed to protecting any school from _ scholarly _ criticism ; and , in fact , we would tell any protestors that this is a discussion list , and if they feel attacked they must defend themselves through discussion . * about civility : we never intended to become a kind of electronic miss manners , and , frankly , it often feels like a very strange role for your uncouth moderators . however , we ' re committed to keeping postings civil in tone because ( 1 ) more than one academic list has ( literally ) gone down in flames - - i . e . , the list has disbanded because the discussions got too personal and heated ; and ( 2 ) , as much as possible , we 'd like everyone - - not just the brave or foolhardy - - to feel comfortable entering a linguist discussion . so we do occasionally return postings with a request that the writer revise toward a less-inflammatory tone . ( we realize , of course , that what is / is not inflammatory is a judgment call ; and our judgment may be wrong . ) however , we have returned very few postings ; and - - interestingly - - we have never received anything but cooperation from the writers . * * * * * * so - - as we ' ve said before - - we think linguist subscribers , all 5700 of you , are a remarkably reasonable , tolerant , and generous set of people . if you have comments or suggestions about the editorial policies we ' ve sketched out above , we would like to hear them . have a very happy new year ! - helen & anthony

                         Workshop on
               Information Integration on the Web
                  in conjunction with WWW 2006

                  http://iiweb2006.cs.uiuc.edu
                      http://www2006.org/

               May 22nd 2006, Edinburgh Scotland

The explosive growth of the Web has amassed a huge number of
information sources on the Internet with unprecedented potential for
accessibility. In particular, in recent years, the Web has
been rapidly deepened with the prevalence of databases and enriched
with structured (or semi-structured) data online. While there are Web
sources relevant to virtually any user's query, the morass of sources
presents a formidable hurdle to effectively finding such sources,
querying them, and aggregating across sources.

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers in a
variety of areas that are all related to the larger problem of
information integration on the Web. We aim to promote the awareness of
large scale integration on the Web, discuss research directions and
agenda, share experience and insights, and build a joint community
across disciplines for data and application benchmarks.

The workshop will discuss research problems for Web-based information
integration, with a focus on dynamic and large scale
integration. These topics include, but are not limited to:

       * Novel integration architectures
       * Data and application benchmarks
       * Information extraction
       * Schema matching
       * Wrapper learning and generation
       * Information gathering
       * View integration
       * Source discovery
       * Source descriptions and meta-data learning
       * Source statistics learning
       * Web-based query execution and optimization
       * Web service composition
       * Record linkage and object consolidation
       * Resolving inconsistency across sources
       * Data mining for integration.

The workshop will consist of a combination of paper presentations,
posters, panels, invited talks and discussion sessions.

*** Submission Instructions

We encourage participants to submit a paper (3-6 pages) or position
abstract (1 page) using the standard WWW paper formatting. Please

"Hello again wind erosion list members!  The wind erosion list has about 100
members but seems very quiet.  I hope everyone is receiving the messages.  I
realize many of the members are not actively involved in wind erosion
research but are still interested in what may be happening in the wind
erosion research area.   But who is now actively involved in wind
erosion-related research and what are the research areas?  Does anyone have a
home page describing their work?

I am Dr. Ted Zobeck, a soil scientist with the USDA, Agricultural Research
Service in Lubbock, Texas.  Our research unit has a home page under
construction at http://lbk131.ars.usda.gov/weru/weru.html.  We will be adding
many new things to the page in the future.  

My general research assignment is to improve our understanding of the effect
of soil
properties on wind erosion. Specifically, this research includes the (1)
development of an
understanding of the relation of wind- induced soil movement and its impact
on PM-10 (dust)
generation and transport, nutrient movement and soil productivity; (2)
development of models
describing changes in near-surface bulk density; aggregate size distribution,
density, and
stability; and surface microrelief as influenced by cropping, tillage and
climatic variables; and
(3) development of models describing surface crust thickness, density,
stability, and the
amount of loose erodible material on the crust as influenced by rainfall and
soil properties. 

I would welcome others to share their interests and/or current projects.  It
will only take a minute and may generate some interesting dialog.

Cheers,
Ted

Hi all,

Do you remember me asking if the HandyBoard was working on an iMac with an USB/Serial adapter?

Well, all the USB/Serial adapters have been back ordered for the last 4 months, so I was unable to find or try any of them ;^(. But I bought an iPort for $60 at my local Fry's (for more info in iPort see http://www.griffintechnology.com/), installed it inside my iMac, plugged my HB in it, fired up IC and it just worked.

The iPort is not for the faint of heart: you have to disassemble your iMac in order to remove the motherboard and put the iPort under it in the really tight case. But hey, it worked and I can now ditch this crappy PC of mine...

On a completely different subject: has somebody compiled the freeware version of IC for NeXTSTEP? I have a cube and a station at home, and I was wondering if somebody ever tried this hardware with IC?

Real viruses are filtered before they reach any mailbox for delivery.

Tose two addresses could be accessible only for internal mail.

And as a user is using this mechanism to build his own database of
spam/non-spam, that's his problem is he sumbit something wrong.

BTW, same forgery or wrong submission problems would exist if each
user had his own set of 2 addresses.

I think the key question is - what functionality does it provide that
you really, really need?  If it provides something really useful,
no-one will have a problem with it using up a small chunk of their

"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 Thugs of South Boston and The Revenge of the Bandit Princess The Geodesic Economy Robert A. Hettinga Sunday, August 25, 2002 (BOSTON) When you think about it one way, the FBI/Winter Hill vs. Patriarcha/Angiulo Cosa Nostra fight was just another race war between thugs. Put crudely, and at its most racist, the FBI and the Winter Hill Gang were the (mostly) Irish thugs, and Patriarcha's ""family"" were, of course, the (mostly) Italian thugs. Think Scorsese's upcoming ""Gangs of New York"", only with counter-reformatory overtones. Hoover's South Boston ""social-club"" putsch, starting in the mid 1960's, was particularly audacious in hindsight. The U.S. Federal Government actually decided to underwrite a reversal of the prohibition-era capture of the nation's rackets by the Italians from the Irish. The fact that the plot was hatched not for New York, but for South Boston, the most Irish place in the US, only makes even more gigantic the Big Lie that was told by the FBI to its ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime there once and for all. The result, as we all found out, wasn't swapping the heroin of Italian Boston mob violence for Irish methadone. Hoover was, posthumously, swapping it for Oxycontin, or crystal methamphetamine - -- or, more properly, PCP. The absolute psychopathology of violence in Whitey Bulger's crack-cocaine-era reign of Boston's drug markets, like the identical FBI-sponsored reigns or violent horror by other also-rans in cities across the US as a whole, went up whole orders of magnitude, not mere percentage points. As Stalin said once, quantity has a quality all it's own. And, make no mistake, J. Edgar Hoover was directly responsible that ""quality"" of carnage, nation-wide. So, yes, on paper at least, it really *was* just the swapping of one gang of racist thugs for another, and the result was, on paper, at least, business as usual. Same stuff, different century, with apparently decent people like Mr. Salvati et.al accidently ground on the gears of ""justice"" like so much hamburger. However, to be much more macabre about it, that hamburger was ""greasing"", if you will, an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could love: a perfectly functioning market, legislated out of existence -- on paper, if nowhere else -- by government fiat and the, back-door, but still elitist, will to power of H.L. Mencken's famous ""bluenoses and busybodies"". It all starts, like all true evil does, from the most innocent of beginnings. What she couldn't do to alcohol, teatotaling Mrs. Grundy then tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a smaller, ""manageable"" demand. The bloody result was, like nine more heads of the hydra, an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition, in more markets, and for more things, as the 20th century wore on. Every time some recreational drug was found to be addictive, or harmful, or physically distasteful, or carcinogenic -- or, now, apparently, fattening -- and then prohibited, exactly the same thing happened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the Volstead years. A *larger* market than before the prohibition. Hugely lucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently scale newly-legislated ""barriers to competition"" imposed on them by the state. Increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of those substances. And, finally, the ultimate in evil -- the kind of evil this country actually fought wars to end -- increasingly coercive axe-handle beatings, by our own government, of the sacred liberty of the average, but now unavoidably-law-breaking, citizenry. As Ayn Rand cynically observed a long time ago, you don't need government if nobody's breaking the law. In some twisted corollary to Parkinson's Law, governments, to survive, *need* more people, breaking more laws, or they can never justify the money they confiscate at tax time. And, to bring us back to the point, David Friedman would probably echo here his father Milton's famous observation that government regulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market, and never the consumer, much less the economy as a whole. Even, *especially*, if those sellers are *breaking* the law, as they are in the increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our government now imposes on us. And there, absent the apparent grace of Mr. Hoover, went Mr. Salvati. In fact, Hayek himself, in ""The Road to Serfdom"", couldn't have predicted any better the gory consequences of Hoover's blatant imposition, ""for our own good"", of Vietnam-era statist power at the neighborhood level. And, furthermore, *Stalin* couldn't have had better ""useful idiots"" than Hoover did -- and neither, by an absolutely literal extension, did Whitey Bulger after Hoover. Useful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle. Idiots who were eating out of Hoover's power-craven hand for the entire middle of the 20th century -- and Whitey Bulger's hand, whether they knew it or not, until the end of the millennium. A time, you'll notice, which saw the increasingly steady imposition of ""mob"" violence, and market control, from both state and illegal interests, way beyond the imaginings of even the most power-mad, rum-running, stock-kiting, movie-flopping, bureau-pumping, Nazi-appeasing Irish-Bostonian Little Caesar. Or, as for that matter, his safely trust-funded, and now strictly political, descendents. In terms of actual financial economics, think of what happened to Mr. Salvati and the others, dead or alive, as a ""transfer-price"", in human lives, of the inevitable consequence of MacNamara-style Vietnam-era Keynesian ""social-cost"" input-output accounting at its most despicable, and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that was committed by Hoover, and his co-religionists in state economic control, in the name of what really was, as you'll now agree, just a race war between thugs up in Boston. This shouldn't be a surprise, really. All race wars are at least fought by thugs, though they're usually conceived elsewhere, and endorsed, at the time, by all the ""right"" people, for all the ""right"" reasons. As far as the FBI itself goes, remember Mancur Olson's observation that a ""prince"" is just a stationary bandit. Though, given his penchant for women's clothing, for other men, and, what's actually obscene, for violently hypocritical treatment of people of his own affectional preference, I suppose we can call J. Edgar Hoover a bandit ""princess"", instead. ""Bandit Queen"", of course, would be a grievous insult to queens -- and real bandits -- everywhere. Cheers, RAH - --------- http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/25/national/25FBI.html?todaysheadlines= &pagewanted=print&position=top The New York Times August 25, 2002 Hoover's F.B.I. and the Mafia: Case of Bad Bedfellows Grows By FOX BUTTERFIELD BOSTON, Aug. 24 - It was March 1965, in the early days of J. Edgar Hoover's war against the Mafia. F.B.I. agents, say Congressional investigators, eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of New England's organized-crime boss, Raymond Patriarca. Two gangsters, Joseph Barboza and Vincent Flemmi, wanted Mr. Patriarca's permission to kill a small-time hoodlum, Edward Deegan, ""as they were having a problem with him,"" according to an F.B.I. log of the conversation. ""Patriarca ultimately furnished this O.K.,"" the F.B.I. reported, and three days later Mr. Deegan turned up dead in an alley, shot six times. It was an extraordinary situation: The Federal Bureau of Investigation had evidence ahead of time that two well-known gangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the New England Mafia was involved. But when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967, the real killers - who also happened to be informers for the F.B.I. - were left alone. Four other men were tried, convicted and sentenced to death or life in prison for the murder, though they had had nothing to do with it. One, Joseph Salvati, who spent 30 years in prison, filed notice with the Justice Department last week that he planned to sue the F.B.I. for $300 million for false imprisonment. His is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the F.B.I., the Justice Department and some F.B.I. agents growing out of the tangled, corrupt collaboration between gangsters and the F.B.I.'s Boston office in its effort to bring down the mob. The lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years in a judicial hearing and a Justice Department inquiry. But some of the most explosive evidence has only recently come to light, including documents detailing conversation in which Mr. Patriarca approved the murder. They were released as part of an investigation by the House Committee on Government Reform, which has pressured the department into turning over records about the F.B.I in Boston. The documents show that officials at F.B.I. headquarters, apparently including Mr. Hoover, knew as long ago as 1965 that Boston agents were employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were protecting them from prosecution. ""J. Edgar Hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal himself,"" said Vincent Garo, Mr. Salvati's lawyer. ""He allowed a witness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect one of his informants."" Mr. Barboza was a crucial witness at trial against Mr. Salvati and may have implicated him because Mr. Salvati owed $400 to a loan shark who worked for Mr. Barboza. Asked about the documents showing that Mr. Hoover knew of Mr. Salvati's innocence when he was put on trial, Gail Marcinkiewicz, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Boston, declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. A Justice Department task force is continuing to investigate misconduct in the Boston office. In one of the first results of the investigation, one retired agent, John J. Connolly, is awaiting sentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and obstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were F.B.I. informers, James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi. Vincent and Stephen Flemmi are brothers. The Government Reform Committee, led by Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, has uncovered memorandums from the Boston office to headquarters in Washington revealing the bureau's knowledge that Vincent Flemmi and Mr. Barboza were involved in killing Mr. Deegan. A memorandum a week after the killing described the crime, including who fired the first shot. Then, on June 4, 1965, Mr. Hoover's office demanded to know what progress was being made in developing Vincent Flemmi as an informer. In a reply five days later, the special agent in charge of the Boston office said that Mr. Flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot wounds but because of his connections to Mr. Patriarca ""potentially could be an excellent informant."" The agent also informed Mr. Hoover that Mr. Flemmi was known to have killed seven men, ""and, from all indications, he is going to continue to commit murder."" Nevertheless, the agent said, ""the informant's potential outweighs the risk involved."" A Congressional investigator called the exchange chilling. ""The most frightening part is that after being warned about Flemmi's murders, the director does not even respond,"" the investigator said. ""There is no message not to use a murderer as a government informant."" The origin of the corruption scandal was public and political pressure on Mr. Hoover to move more forcefully against the growing power of the Mafia, which he had largely ignored. In Boston, F.B.I. agents recruited Mr. Barboza and Mr. Flemmi and developed close ties to a rival criminal organization, the Winter Hill Gang, led by Mr. Bulger. Both sides got what they wanted, according to the investigations and the trial of Mr. Connolly. The F.B.I. got information that eventually helped destroy the Patriarca and Angiulo families, which controlled organized crime in New England. Mr. Bulger's gang was able to take over the rackets in Boston, sell drugs and even commit murder while the F.B.I. looked the other way. One reason the F.B.I. may not have used its information about Mr. Patriarca's involvement in the Deegan murder, Congressional investigators say, is that it came from an illegal listening device in his Providence, R.I., headquarters. The F.B.I. agent who transcribed the conversation made it appear that the information was coming from unnamed informants, to disguise the use of the device, the investigators say. Mr. Salvati, a former truck driver, now 69, had his sentence commuted in 1997 by Gov. William F. Weld. Last year, while he was still on parole, his murder conviction was dismissed by a Massachusetts state judge after the Justice Department task force made public documents suggesting his innocence. Two of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison. Their survivors have joined the fourth man, Peter Limone, in a $375 million lawsuit against the Justice Department. Mr. Limone was sentenced to die in the electric chair. His life was spared only when Massachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1974. Mr. Salvati lives in a modest apartment in Boston's North End with his wife, Marie, who visited him in prison every week during those 30 years. Each week Mr. Salvati sent her a romantic card, which she put on the television set. It was, Mr. Garo said, all they had of each other. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: PGP 7.5 iQA/AwUBPWmB2sPxH8jf3ohaEQL9qgCgxHq0ee06UEsNv8u8wgvmjf9K7S4An3Rb 3srsGomWjNDwIaKoEHOfNHpI =OELD -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- --  ----------------- R.

Ok, well, I have a rationale for it: make it possible to get rid of 
eggs as a mechanism for supporting easy_install.  Many people 
(yourself included) have criticized eggs as an installation 
mechanism, and this is an alternative that gets rid of .egg files and 
directories in that case, and most of the need for .pth file usage as well.


>If there was a chance that the infrastructure being developed

Yes, I'm of course primarily interested in Python-specific tools such 
as virtualenv, easy_install, buildout, and the as-yet-unwritten 
uninstallers, package listers, etc., that can usefully read or write such data.

The data isn't for them to use to meet their use cases, it's for them 
to *provide* so that Python tools don't stomp on, uninstall, or 
otherwise interfere with files installed by the system.  In other 
words, for system packagers, it's a communication from the system to 
Python, rather than the other way around.  Even though the distutils 
will build the file in the bdist, the system packaging tools would be 
free to generate their own file listing and signatures and such.


>Do you also envision the objective of PEP 262, then? I.e.
>to provide a database of installed packages, in .../install-db?

In each directory relative to a given sys.path directory, yes.  That 
is, installing a distutils distribution to any directory would result 
in a file being added to an install-db within that 
directory.  (Assuming we use the proposed implementation model of PEP 
262, which at the moment I don't see any substantial obstacle to.)

I probably should have brought this up, in fact, I think I mentioned 
it in a previous thread, but I would like to see PEP 262 add a way to 
say ""this is a system-installed package, *don't touch*"".  The idea 
again is not to do the job of the native packaging system, but rather 
to ensure that Python-specific tools (e.g. easy_install and friends) 
do not interfere or conflict with it.

A big problem in the early development of easy_install, even using 
eggs, was that there was no way to tell whether it was safe to delete 
or overwrite an existing file or directory that was already installed 
on the system.  A mechanism like this would allow tools like 
easy_install to say, ""oh, your system packager has a conflicting 
package here, you need to use that tool to sort this out if you 
really want to do something here.  I'm not going to touch 
that.""  Without something like this, there is no way to tell the 
difference on many systems between a system package and something the 
user has put there with ""sudo python setup.py install"".

Dear Beloved in Christ,

It is by the grace of God that I received
Christ,knowing the truth and the truth have set me
free.Having known the truth, I had no choice than to
do what is lawful and right in the sight of God for
eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of
God�s mercy and glory upon my life.

I am Mrs Maureen Clarks from Netherlands.I
am married to Dr.Franklyn Clarks who worked with
Chevron/Texaco in Oman for twenty years before he
died in the year 2001.We were married for twenty-seven
years without a child. 

He died during one of the riots in the 
region of Iraq where he went to work outstations.
He was held hostage and slain to death by protesting 
militias of the region. Before his
death we were both born again christians.

My late husband acquired a considerable sum of money
through his  resourcefulness and effectiveness through
the duration of his stay in Oman and his share of the family 
inheritance,  These monies are currently lodged in a finance 
institution in Europe. I am desperately in need of your 
assistance and guidance in the dispatch of these monies 
for the sole purpose of ameliorating the suffering of thousands of 
sick, poor and down trodden individuals ecumenically.

I was recently diagnosed with cancer of the lungs and
the doctors have made it absolutely lucid that this
disease is terminal. The doctors were not exact about
how long I have to live but I am in the know that the
disease has ravaged my body and left me at the mercy
of endless cocktail of drugs been administered to me.
The drugs have gone a long way in alleviating the
pains, but I still feel my life gradually ebbing away.

Presently, I'm with my laptop in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for oesophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to victims of the Tsunami disaster in Asia and other charity organizations. Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them. Please,I beg you in the name of God to help me collect the deposit and the interest accrued from the company and distribute it accordingly.

I am currently recieving treatments at the Ireland hospital with the 
address details below.:
  ROYAL VICTORIAL HOSPITAL
  GROSVENOR ROAD
  BELFAST
  BT12  6BA
  ROOM 4779


I do not have any existing family member to my
knowledge to assist me in procuring these monies
before the stipulated time. I established this contact
with you solely out of need and desperation,
communication with you was completely fortuitous and
serendipitous.

I will ask that you inform me of your decision to
assist or decline, please ensure that you make your
decision based on nobility and humanity. Your
assistance will remain forever invaluable and
beneficial to thousands of children across the world.

Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I
stated herein.

I await your urgent reply.

Yours in Christ,

Mrs Maureen Clarks

70c is the absolute maximum operating temperature, it will die if used
above that temperature for a short length of time. Get hold of a spec
sheet and you will see all of the dynamic specifications ie. clock
frequency, signal propogation etc is rated at 25c. Gamers don't mind if
their system crashes when they overclock and run at close to the thermal
limit, but if you are building a server you want to get your temperature
below 50c if you want it to be reliable under stress.

Raw Politics tonight: Immigration bill called illegal, Dems find success online

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House and top senators called it a breakthrough agreement on immigration reform, but now some House members are calling the deal struck last week a violation of the rule of law...and they say it is destined for failure, CNN's Tom Foreman reports in tonight's ""Raw Politics.""

Also, in the battle of the internet, Democrats have taken a shocking lead. The top three Democrats are raising twice as much money on the internet as the top Republicans.

And it could be a great catchy phrase, or a terrific misstep: the campaign to make B.O. popular.

"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- CERT Advisory CA-2002-04 Buffer Overflow in Microsoft Internet Explorer    Original release date: February 25, 2002    Last revised: --    Source: CERT/CC    A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file. Systems Affected      * Microsoft Internet Explorer      * Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express      * Other  applications  that use the Internet Explorer HTML rendering        engine Overview    Microsoft  Internet  Explorer contains a buffer overflow vulnerability    in   its   handling  of  embedded  objects  in  HTML  documents.  This    vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the    victim's  system  when  the  victim visits a web page or views an HTML    email message. I. Description    Internet Explorer supports the  directive, which can be used to    include  arbitrary objects in HTML documents. Common types of embedded    objects  include multimedia files, Java applets, and ActiveX controls.    The SRC attribute specifies the source path and filename of an object.    For  example,  a  MIDI  sound might be embedded in a web page with the    following HTML code:          Internet  Explorer  uses  attributes of the  directive and MIME    information from the web server to determine how to handle an embedded    object. In most cases, a separate application or plugin is used.    A  group  of  Russian  researchers,  SECURITY.NNOV,  has reported that    Internet  Explorer  does  not properly handle the SRC attribute of the      directive. An HTML document, such as a web page or HTML email    message,  that  contains  a crafted SRC attribute can trigger a buffer    overflow,  executing  code with the privileges of the user viewing the    document.  Microsoft  Internet  Explorer, Outlook, and Outlook Express    are vulnerable. Other applications that use the Internet Explorer HTML    rendering  engine, such as Windows compiled HTML help (.chm) files and    third-party email clients, may also be vulnerable.    The  CERT/CC  is  tracking  this  vulnerability  as  VU#932283,  which    corresponds  directly  to the ""buffer overrun"" vulnerability described    in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-005.    This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CAN-2002-0022. II. Impact    By  convincing  a  user to view a malicious HTML document, an attacker    can  cause  the  Internet  Explorer  HTML  rendering engine to execute    arbitrary  code  with  the  privileges of the user who viewed the HTML    document. This vulnerability could be exploited to distribute viruses,    worms, or other malicious code. III. Solution Apply a patch    Microsoft  has  released a cumulative patch for Internet Explorer that    corrects  this  vulnerability and several others. For more information    about the patch and the vulnerabilities, please see Microsoft Security    Bulletin MS02-005:      http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-005.asp Disable ActiveX Controls and Plugins    In  Internet Explorer, plugins may be used to view, play, or otherwise    process  embedded  objects.  The  execution  of  embedded  objects  is    controlled  by the ""Run ActiveX Controls and Plugins"" security option.    Disabling  this  option  will  prevent  embedded  objects  from  being    processed,   and   will   therefore   prevent   exploitation  of  this    vulnerability.    According to MS02-005:      The  vulnerability  could  not  be  exploited  if  the ""Run ActiveX      Controls and Plugins"" security option were disabled in the Security      Zone  in which the page was rendered. This is the default condition      in  the  Restricted Sites Zone, and can be disabled manually in any      other Zone.    At  a minimum, disable the ""Run ActiveX Controls and Plugins"" security    option  in  the  Internet Zone and the zone used by Outlook or Outlook    Express.  The  ""Run  ActiveX  Controls and Plugins"" security option is    disabled  in  the  ""High""  zone  security  setting.  Instructions  for    configuring  the Internet Zone to use the ""High"" zone security setting    can be found in the CERT/CC Malicious Web Scripts FAQ:      http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_FAQ.html#steps Apply the Outlook Email Security Update    Another  way to effectively disable the processing of ActiveX controls    and  plugins  in  Outlook  is  to  install  the Outlook Email Security    Update.  The  update  configures Outlook to open email messages in the    Restricted  Sites  Zone,  where the ""Run ActiveX Controls and Plugins""    security  option  is  disabled  by  default.  In  addition, the update    provides  further  protection  against malicious code that attempts to    propagate via Outlook.      * Outlook 2002 and Outlook Express 6        The functionality of the Outlook Email Security Update is included        in Outlook 2002 and Outlook Express 6.      * Outlook 2000        http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/Out2ksec.aspx      * Outlook 98        http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/9798/Out98sec.aspx Appendix A. - Vendor Information    This  appendix  contains  information  provided  by  vendors  for this    advisory.

My last statement about puppet stringing being your only option is
true if you need to do something complex that needs to respond ssh's
output.  If all you need to do is run a command on a remote host then

my @host_files_in_tmp = qx(ssh user@host ls /tmp);

Will work just fine.

"  
Mr.Ken Quattara.
Ghana.

Good day to you!
I am requesting for your assistance in a deal of Considerable
financial gain for both of us. 
I am Ken Quattara, I was the Personal Assistant (P.A) to the former
President of The Federal Republic of Togo, the late President
Gnassingbe Eyadema.
In the last week of January 2005, two security deposit boxes were
deposited on behalf of Mr. Eyadema by me with a company in Ghana.
The boxes contained 35 million dollars in cash. I have the
certificate of deposit issued by the company for the boxes. As his
trusted P.A I had employed the services of this particular company
to arrange the shipment of the boxes to Europe on his behalf were
they were to be picked up by a foreign associate of his at that
time, a French man.
This was not the first time I had arranged this kind of shipment for
Mr.Eyadema using this company. The boxes were labeled ""photographic
materials"" to elude customs and other checks.
Unfortunately, because he was ill-disposed at the time the French
man was no longer able to make the trip to meet with the company's
agents at the destination point. So the agents who accompanied the
boxes had to deposit them in a storage facility pending when he
could come.
On the 5th of February 2005, Mr Eyadema passed on while he was being
evacuated abroad for emergency medical treatment. He had been ill
for some years.
Following the demise of my former Boss, his associate withdrew, so
the boxes have been in storage since then. It was my function to
issue his associates Letters Of Athorization signed by me to pick up
boxes containing valuables and money. They banked money for him in
various pre-selected banks in Europe and Asia. The agents only
assisted the associates in the process to ensure that everything was
done under diplomatic immunity and within the stipulated laws in the
countries where such transactions took place.
I am asking for your assistance and involvement so that we can get
the money for ourselves. I can not do this on my own because i can't
so to say, authorize myself. If you accept to act as an associate of
the Late Mr Eyadema, I can issue to you the Letter of Authorization
for the purpose of reclaiming the boxes on his behalf for our own
benefit. As the beneficiary it will be your responsibility and
obligation (as stated in the coded agreement between the depositor
and the company) to reclaim and repossess the boxes from the storage
facility. 
You will be required to meet with the company's assigned agent(s)
personally.
This way you will see the boxes for yourself and sign the necessary
documents to reposses the boxes. The agent(s) will assist you to
bank the funds and then thereafter you can transfer money to other
offshore accounts. This was how itwas done with previous associates.
 Or you may choose to arrange something else with the agent(s). If
however you can not meet with any assigned agent, as the
beneficiary/associate to the Late Eyadema,you could request that an
alternative arrangement be made for you. You will have to discuss
this with the agent(s) yourself.
I assure you that everything will go smoothly if you choose to
cooperate with the agent(s). There is no illegality involved here.
If you do decide to get involved then i expect total commitment from
you. If you can do this, i am offering you 3 million dollars as your
own share.
If you are interested in this deal, then contact me immediately via
email(furnished above) for further details. Thank you for your time. 
 
Regards,
Ken Quattara

abstract :
liquidity risk , as opposed to credit and market risks , has received little
attention in professional or academic journals . we argue that analyzing bank
liquidity risk can be viewed as a variation of credit risk analysis . after
introducing some concepts and definitions , the presentation defines a
framework allowing to measure a bank ' s structural liquidity risk . it then
shows that combining the framework with modern credit risk measurement tools
leads to a liquidity risk var measure . the presentation then offers
concluding comments on the integration of the liquidity risk measurement
framework within enterprise - wide risk management .

"We have a Soundblaster PCI card... less than a year old... I think a
Soundblaster 128.  Still have some variance even with the change in the
thread priority.  The latency I am measuring is between the output of the
PIO-12 and the output of the sound card.  We did this with an Oscilloscope,
but then I did it again by building a voltage divider and placing it
between my sound output and the input on the headbox of my Neuroscan
synamps (i.e. to down-step the voltage into the mvolt range, so that the
Synamps can handle it... not with a subject hooked up, mind you).  

I conducted a couple of tests:  the sound latency test in TimeDX, and
another test where I put together a simple item file with triggers and
sounds.  I then rectified and averaged the sound file output over 30
trials, and took the mean onset latency, defined as the time from the
trigger to the half amplitude of the sound signal.  I have a jitter range
of about +/- 3 msec.  This doesn't appear to affect our pilot ERP
recordings, nor our pilot startle recordings... but I would like to
decrease this if at all possible.  If I can't decrease it by purchasing
commercial hardware (a sound card), I may build a buffered ""AND"" gate, i.e.
that will store the 8 bit word from the CIO/DIO 24 and write it out
simultaneously with, or at least within nanoseconds of the measured sound
pulse (measured from the output of the sound card).

Do you have recommendations for fast, buffered sound cards?  I've solved
the latency problem""  It seems that measuring the latency, and then
replacing the default ""observed latency"" value with the measured value
(around 17 msec) in TimeDX took care of this.  The slop range is still
around +/- 3 msec.... This would be acceptable in a pinch, but i'd still
like to decrease it if I can, even if it means purchasing a better sound card.

thanks,

John

"FROM THE DESK OF MASSAN AHMED
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO.
Dear Sir,
              I am the manager of bill and exchange foreign remittance at 
the department of Bank Of Africa (BOA).
In my departmentn we discovered an abandone sum of $ 22.6 m US dollars 
(Twenty two  Millon six hundred thousand  US dollars) . In an account that 
belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family 
in a concord plane crash in the year 2000 in paris that almost took the 
whole life of the pasengeres on board.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his 
supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash 
leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my depar
tment now decided to make this  businness proposal to you and release the 
money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and 
subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don;t want this 
money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.
The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclamed after ten years, the money will be transfered into the Bank 
treasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin 
in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner 
and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in 
respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for 
expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for ;me and my 
colleagues.

Thereafter I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement 
accoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate 
trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank 
as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your 
bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and 
effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.

   Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text 
of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this 
transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear 
as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. 
Trusting to hear from you immediately.
  Your;s faithfully,
  MR.MASSAN AHMED
(Bill and exchange manager)
  BANK OF AFRICA (BOA).

Thanks so much.  gcc's -Wc++-compat hatefully ignores these kinds of problems,
and other issues prevent me from combing through with a C++ compiler.  I'll
take a look at the rest of these this evening, and hopefully work on 
-Wc++-compat as well.

If you want to use SURBL and URIBL all you need to do is enable network tests:

"Louise,
 
Instead of sending us a 1-paragraph extension letter Wed night, Allegheny sent a one-sided 4-pager yesterday afternoon.
 
The tone of the letter was inappropriate (Las Vegas agreeing it was in default, but AESC being kind enough to give us a chance).  Also, the business points were overeaching and/or vague.
 
The team turned the draft last night to clarify the business points and tone.  Comments from Legal (commercial, litigation, finance), Finance, Credit, Orig.
 
Parquet spoke with Dan Gordon to share our major comments.  Gordon was non-commital but said that ""sounds like we are pretty close"".
 
Basic deal we have put in the letter:
 
- AESC believes they can terminate
- LVCII believes we have complied with tolling agreement
- Parties will work for 5 business days to execute Pledge agreement, Security agreement, Deed of Trust, Subordination and Non-Disturbance Agreement
- AESC gets subordinated lien on ground lease
- Ground lease has non-disturbance provisions (LVCI can not break lease for LVCII)
- AESC gets subordinated lien on LM6000 and Transformer contracts
- Natwest loan agreement gets prepaid
- AESC acknowledges that LVCII is in compliance with security provisions of tolling agreement if we complete the above
- Increase collateral threshold to $50MM for both parties in Master Power Agreement
- No additional margin calls made prior to December 31, 2001
- $16MM Margin call made July 31 is withdrawn
- AESC keeps the $160MM+ L/C in place to cover existing exposure
- Enron Corp guarantess EPMI for $60MM
 
We are waiting to hear back from Allegheny.  Plan is to have both teams with legal and commercial have conf call to review document today. 
 
DASH has been circulated to the group for comment and will be finalized today.
 
Parquet is reviewing all of their previous comments on the security agreements so we are prepared to dig inot them over the next 5 business days if we get this letter executed.
 
Finance is preparing necessary documentation to execute plan.
 
Parquet is in his office and is obviously available to discuss - 415-782-7820.
 
I am around and will participate when our next meeting is scheduled.

Chris

It is true that the first comment is badly mangled...

Hm, this intrigues me, it would seem to me that the only way for SAS  
to check that only one of your colleagues uses it at any given time  
would be to contact some sort of online server. Does that mean that  
SAS can only be run when you have internet access?

Or is it simply a clause on the license, without any ""runtime checks""?

"Once upon a time, Ralf wrote : > Skipping all RPM build parts except for the actual packing is not > possible Actually it is (sort of). To answer partly the original question, this might have been useful once the %files error was corrected : rpmbuild -bi --short-circuit  This will skip all the way to the %install and start from there. Of course, you need to have already done everything else before, and this will _not_ produce any rpm files, but will at least tell you if everything is now able to finish successfully. Sure, it's not perfect since if the %files error was actually because entries were missing you'll notice it only once the package is really installed. But for multiple typos in the %files section (like when you're writing a spec file after 2AM ;-)) it can come in handy :-) It's also very useful if you need to override some Makefile variables during install, when the simple cases like ""%makeinstall"" or ""make install DESTDIR=%{buildroot}"" don't work.

The Politics of Intellectual Property Rights and Access to Medicines
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-love/the-politics-of-intellect_b_49782.html
By James Love
Posted May 29, 2007 | 09:19 AM (EST)

On Wednesday, May 23, the main UN body for health passed a new
resolution on Public health, innovation and intellectual property. The
resolution was applauded by the public health community, and was
supported by all WHO member states, except one -- the United States.

Earlier, on May 10, 2007, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Ways and Means Chair
Charles Rangel announced a ""new bipartisan"" trade package that addressed
some of these same issues. The new agreement between the House
Leadership and the Bush Administration on trade policy included a
section on intellectual property rights (IPR) and access to medicine in
developing countries.

The Rangel/Pelosi trade deal addressed a wide number of issues, and drew
lots of fire from groups who opposed various elements, including Huffpo
blogger David Sirota. Some health activists were highly critical of the
provisions on IPR and access to medicines in developing countries. On
this aspect of the deal, our impression was more favorable.

Rangel and Pelosi were able to deliver some substantial changes in trade
policy on three highly technical but very important issue. As set out in
this analysis, in every case, the new trade agreement reduces barriers
to the use of generic medicines in poor countries. I agree with the
groups that wanted more from the Democrats. But I was perhaps more
impressed with how much was achieved in this first step toward a new
trade agenda. I hope it is not the last.

The fact that the new trade deal was an agreement with the Bush
Administration means it involved compromises. On the issue of IPR and
access to medicines, any concessions that would help poor people living
in poor countries were bitterly opposed by the pharmaceutical industry,
a tough lobby in this town. The drug companies not only have huge sway
with the Republicans, they have a lot of influence with democrats,
including those who are making speech after speech on the need to
protect our intellectual property. The new trade deal addressed the most
important three issues in the current trade deals with poor countries
(linking patents to drug registration, patent extensions beyond 20
years, and the new IPR right in pharmaceutical test data). The Bush
administration made real concessions, and patients will benefit from this.

The World Health Assembly (WHA) is the main governing body for the UN's
World Health Organization. The passage of resolution WHA60.30 last week
was both (a) another indication the current trade system is broken, and
(b) hope for a new and better paradigm that will serve everyone's
interest better.

The WHO debate on IPR and medicines is quite important, but virtually
unknown in the one country where it is most important -- the United
States. Few members of Congress are following the debate, and there has
been zero press coverage. In Europe and in developing countries, more is
known. In the past several months there have been high level meetings on
these issues held or scheduled in Geneva, Paris, the Netherlands, Munich
and Brussels. The European Parliament has engaged. The U.S. Congress has
not.

Last week the WHA resisted the pressure from the Bush Administration and
gave the WHO a fresh mandate to provide technical assistance to poor
countries who want to issue compulsory licenses on patents on medicines
or take other measures to promote access to generic medicines. But they
did not stop there. The WHO is debating the need for a new approach for
financing new drugs, one that does not ""link"" R&D incentives to drug
prices. Here, the Bush administration has not been horrible, at least in
the past year. But, nothing will really change unless there is more
leadership from the United States.

This is the basic deal. A number of public health experts, groups and
government officials are now saying it is a mistake to have a global
trade framework that is devoted to higher drug prices, as the primary or
only instrument to promote global medical R&D.

* First, they argue the trade framework should be refashioned as
agreements to pay for R&D, and that countries should be free to choose
all sorts of ways to do that, including public sector funding of open
source R&D projects, uses of innovation prizes, or other innovative ways
to finance R&D. This new trade framework should deal both with the
sustainable sources of finance, and make real efforts to address
priority setting, including efforts to ensure adequate investment in
treatments that concern illnesses that disproportionately impact poor
people living in poor countries.

* Second, they argue that private R&D incentives should not be linked to
drug prices at all, and that rewards for innovation in new products
should be more closely tied to evidence that the products actually
improve health care outcomes. A number of countries are now calling for
broader uses of prizes to stimulate innovation, an idea that is gaining
traction in a number of different areas these days, including not only
to stimulate R&D for new medicines, but also for a number of other
public goods.

This new debate over the global framework to support medical innovation
is important, and one that should be on the radar screen here -- in the
country that is:

1. The biggest global bully for big pharma, and increasingly isolated in
world public opinion, as illustrated by last week's WHA decision.
2. The biggest funder of medical R&D in the world, including both
private sector and public sector investments.
3. The biggest purchaser of generic AIDS drugs in the world.
4. The most in need of domestic reform to control drug prices, among
high income countries.

Jean, 

Thought you'd find this interesting.  It's an excerpt from an analyst's note
out this AM.

A Perspective: R.I.P. Enron:
It took sixteen years to build Enron into a $63 billion asset powerhouse,
but only 24 days for it to disintegrate.

The fatal flaw was the aggressive accounting and leveraging done in various
off balance sheet partnerships (Special Purpose Entities), which apparently
became too aggressive to fully disclose. Wall Street had no idea of their holdings,
their leverage or their derivative exposures. The SPEs mutated into
something beyond the pale, becoming a company within a company. This evidently began
30 months ago when the new management regime (Skilling, Fastow, et al)
sanctioned their evolution. Make no mistake: they were cleverly contrived. They
involved conventional asset & debt transfers off the books, coupled with fair value
(asset mark-to-market) accounting and synthetic equity financing. This
allowed for considerable earnings management and the appearance of cost-free equity.

If nothing else, they now appear in hindsight to have been vanity deals: very
New Economy, very Virtual and very aggressive. But no clients ever complained,
to our knowledge. Yet ENE clearly crossed the GAAP reporting lines, as the
latest 8-K attests, and the dual role of the CFO (sitting on both sides of the
table in the LJM transactions), profiting highly in the process, created in the LJM
partnership natural conflicts of interest now being investigated by the SEC.
Because of this elementary mistake in any seasoned judgment, which passed
muster at every level, the most successful energy company of the 90s was vaporized
in the marketplace. The main thing that brought ENE down was hubris. It had
used up all of its credibility when the partnerships were brought to light. If these
were fully revealed two years ago, a collapse would have been very unlikely.

"Josh,

The PIO12 card outputs a byte (i.e. 8 bits).   A single byte can represent 
decimal values 0 to 255 (256 distinct values) .

10001010 is the binary representation of decimal 138, for example.   This 
is because each binary place  represents a power of 2.  Thus, a ""1"" in the 
right-most column represents 2^0, and the left-most represents 2^8 (i.e. 
128).  Thus, binary 10001010 = base ten 2^7 + 2^3 + 2^1 =  128 + 8 + 2 = 138.

If I am not mistaken, firing each output separately should be straightforward:

Output bit 0 = 00000001 = 2^ 0 =  1
Output bit 1 = 00000010 = 2^ 1 = 2
Output bit 2 = 00000100 = 2^ 2 = 4
Output bit 3 = 00001000 = 2^ 3 = 8
Output bit 4 = 00010000 = 2^ 4 = 16
Output bit 5 = 00100000 = 2^ 5 = 32
Output bit 6 = 01000000 = 2^ 6 = 64
Output bit 7 = 10000000 = 2^ 7 = 128

Good luck,

JK

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron to axe 500 in attempt to boost profits.
By JULIE EARLE.

Enron, the US energy group and trader, yesterday confirmed it would cut 500 jobs, or 10 per cent of its European workforce, in an attempt to improve profits. 
Ken Lay, Enron's chairman, is under pressure to restore the company's share price, which has slid more than 60 per cent in the past 12 months.
The cuts, flagged last week, will scale back operations Mr Lay had previously said would be critical to the company's future growth. John Sherriff, Enron Europe's president, said business continued to grow in Europe in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions, but the company was ""seeking ways to do more with less in order to maintain earnings growth"". 
Enron Europe has 5000 employees. Mr Sherriff said the headcount would be cut by between 5 and 10 per cent, and the company hoped to achieve this through voluntary severance. 
Gordon Howald, an energy analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities in New York, said Enron had been criticised over its strategy to increase cash flows. 
""They are trying to slash their workforce and are selling Portland General Electric. This is good timing. When financials are under pressure, it probably makes good sense,"" he said, adding there had been rumours of US job cuts, outside of the previously announced Broadband division job cuts in July. 
Enron yesterday denied there were further job cuts planned in the US. 
Last week Enron said it had agreed to sell the electricity utility Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas for $1.8bn, a disposal it had been planning for some time. 
Enron shares closed $1.81, or 5.4 per cent, higher at $35.20 in New York yesterday.

In college, they call it grading on the curve. In business, it's known as forced ranking. 
In both cases, regardless of performance, someone's going to fail. The practices reward those who perform better than their peers. That's the American way.
But they also can punish those doing good work -- just not as good as others. In college, grading on the curve means failing a course despite learning the material and either being forced to repeat it or flunking out. In business, forced ranking means that every year some arbitrary number -- often 10 percent -- get put on notice that they must improve. Or sometimes they get fired. 
Traditionally, business has used competency-based evaluations of employees. That is, can they do the work? Forced ranking sets up a totem pole. Everyone has a place on that pole, from the top to the bottom. 
And the pole gets chopped off from the bottom. 
About 20 percent of American companies use forced ranking, according to an article on the subject in the Harvard Management Update, a newsletter from the publishing arm of the business school. 
Some companies used forced ranking only for top managers. Others use the system for all managers, or all exempt employees who are not on hourly wages. 
Some of the most admired companies use the process -- General Electric, for example. Here in Houston, Enron uses a five-point scale with 15 percent in the bottom ranking. 
Proponents of forced ranking say it makes managers confront a perennial problem: that of low-performing managers and employees. 
Not only do the low performers cause problems now. If they neither improve nor leave, they block promotion for people who might do a better job. 
Productivity and morale sag. Fewer top people want to join the company. The best performers leave. 
In what seems to be the endless American cycle of hiring and layoffs, forced ranking also gives managers some objective criteria to use when it's once again time to let people go. 
But forced ranking also can raise the usual cries of discrimination that any ranking system brings. At Microsoft, an African-American plaintiff sued, claiming his low ranking came because of his race. At Ford Motor Co., which has dropped forced ranking, the charges of discrimination came from middle-aged white males. 
Forced ranking has provided a much-needed boost at some companies -- ones that have not confronted performance problems of managers over the years. 
Still, after a few cycles of forced ranking, companies must decide what's next. So you've weeded out the slackers. You've helped those who needed help to improve their performance. Overall, the company is doing a much better job of getting the products or services out the door. 
Inevitably, companies will reach a point of diminishing returns. If every manager or exempt employee is at least competent at his or her job, is it really worth it to rate and arbitrarily fire 10 percent or so of them every year? 
Sure, that's going to keep everyone on their toes as they scramble to keep their jobs. But it may not be all that good in encouraging teamwork. 
And, as France's army found in World War I, the practice of decimation -- arbitrarily shooting 10 percent of your own troops to encourage the others to fight harder -- does not tend to raise morale. 
Forced ranking also seems to me to be based on the wrong premise -- that is, that companies need to be filled with high-performance people from top to bottom to succeed. 
That may not necessarily be true. Every organization really needs a mix of people. For example, organizations need a leavening of malcontents. They stir up things, get people thinking, challenge assumptions. Yet an organization composed of nothing but malcontents won't work. 
Sure, every company needs top performers. They are the yeast that causes the organization to rise. But companies also need the steady and the sturdy and people with limited imagination to take care of the millions of details that must be faced every day. 
It's the equivalent of taking out the trash. It's not inspiring work, but unless it gets done, it gets smelly.

India: Greenfield Shipping rejects German bailout offer

10/11/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Fin. Times Info Ltd-Asia Africa Intel Wire. Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd. All Rights Res'd

NEW DELHI, Oct. 10 IN a fresh twist to the crisis facing the $220-million LNG shipping deal for Dabhol Power Company, German-based KG Finance Group has made a proposal to the promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company to bail out the project. 
""The promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company, however, rejected the proposal ab initio,"" sources familiar with the developments told Business Line.
The bailout proposal was made by the German agency during discussions held in London recently between the representatives of the three promoters (Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, SCI and Atlantic Commercial Inc) and the lending consortium led by ANZ Investment Bank. 
As per the offer, the KG Finance Group would facilitate the completion of the 137,000-cubic-metre capacity tanker to be used for transporting LNG from Oman to Enron's power plant at Dabhol. 
The LNG carrier would be converted into a German asset by bringing it under a special purpose vehicle (SPV) registered in Germany. The tanker would be operated by German crew. 
The Greenfield Shipping Company is registered in the Cayman Islands and would fly a Maltese flag. The German entity had also proposed to tie up finances for the entire arrangement through a mix of public and private funding. 
KG Finance Group was of the view that the Greenfield Shipping Company had paid an ""unbelievably higher price"" for the LNG tanker by contracting it a rate of $220 million. In its reckoning, the vessel building price was at least $15 to 20 million higher than the market price prevailing then. 
Against this backdrop, KG Finance Group had told the representatives of the Greenfield Shipping Company assembled in London that the tanker would fetch not more than $65,000 per day as charter hire rates, the sources said. This was against the charter hire rate of $98,600 per day agreed with Dabhol Power Company. 
The German agency had also said that it would charge a commission of 3 per cent for finalising the deal. 
The proposal was turned down by the promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company on the grounds that transferring the asset from a Maltese flag to a German flag would deprive the tanker of depreciation benefits. 
""Besides, the project will not break even at a charter hire rate of $65,000 per day,"" the sources said. 
The offer made by KG Finance Group comes in the wake of a crisis facing the promoters of the LNG shipping project after the lenders suspended the last tranche of the project loan of $55 million, citing an event of default. 
The project promoters will not be able to take possession of the LNG carrier if the remaining project cost of $55 million is not paid to the shipbuilding yard. The crisis has been compounded by the fact that Enron is planning to exit from the project by selling its 20 per cent stake in the venture. 
While various permutations and combinations have been discussed between the joint venture partners, nothing has taken a concrete shape so far, dragging the venture into deeper uncertainty. 
While making its offer, the German entity had drawn attention to the not-so-rosy LNG market globally. The LNG vessel prices are now ruling at about $165 million. 
""Besides, about 24 LNG vessels are lying idle world- over. Even two new vessels delivered recently are lying idle without any commitment to charter,"" the sources said, pointing to the bleak scenario prevailing at the moment which has steeply driven down the charter hire rates for LNG ships.

CM rejects NCP plea for probe into Enron dispute

10/11/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

MUMBAI: Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has rejected a demand by the Nationalist Congress party (NCP) for reconsideration of a judicial probe being set up into the Enron controversy. 
Mr Deshmukh told a press conference here on Wednesday, ``As far as we are concerned, the issue of a judicial probe into Enron is over.''
Deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal, sitting adjacent to him, kept mum when Mr Deshmukh's attention was drawn to the demand by the NCP, the principal partner of the ruling Democratic Front. 
NCP president Sharad Pawar had stated at a public meeting last week that his party would not be responsible if the state had to pay arbitration costs to Enron running into hundreds of crores of rupees. Similarly, NCP spokesman Vasant Chavan had alleged that the decision to institute the judicial probe needed to be reconsidered. 
Mr Deshmukh's outright rejection of the demand could be another reason for tension between the Congress and the NCP, sources said. 
Hiking of water supply charges by the DF government is another major issue that has been hanging fire. Maharashtra Pradesh Congress committee president Govindrao Adik and other leaders had attacked the government's decision to the hike. When Mr Deshmukh was asked to state the government's response, he announced that the matter would be referred to the DF coordination committee.

cancelled a $2.8 billion LNG power plant with Enron.  Bhatnagar
worked with the Government, lenders and other stakeholders to
resuscitate the project and led the $2 billion financing for the
second phase of the Dabhol Power Plant, which eventually became the
topic of a Harvard Business School case study.

AEP Puts Wholesale Operation Behind Growth Targets
By Jon Kamp
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/10/2001

COLUMBUS, Ohio -(Dow Jones)- Top officials from American Electric Power Co. (AEP) outlined the utility's growth objectives in a conference with financial analysts Wednesday, emphasizing its plan to lean on wholesale operations for future growth. 
AEP also noted how a planned corporate separation plan, expected to wrap up by the end of 2001 pending regulatory approval, will help by separating and clearly defining the company's unregulated operations.
""That is clearly going to be the major growth driver for AEP,"" said Henry Fayne, executive vice president at AEP and the newly-named head of the company's regulated operations. Fayne is also the outgoing chief financial officer at AEP. 
AEP officials said the company is targeting 8% earnings per share growth on a year-to-year basis for an undefined period. Because regulated utility operations are typically a slow-growth business, AEP expects wholesale operations to increase their contribution to earnings by at least 10% each year going forward. 
On a shorter term basis, Fayne reiterated AEP's guidance for 2001 earnings in the $3.50 to $3.60 a diluted share range. A poll of 12 analysts by Thomson Financial/First Call, by comparison, shows the company earning $3.59 a diluted share for the year. 
AEP also maintained its 2002 earnings guidance, though it said a planned power plant acquisition announced this week should boost results by at least six cents. The company said Monday that it plans to buy two 2,000 megawatt coal-fired power plants in the U.K. from Edison International's (EIX) Edison Mission Energy unit for $960 million. 
With that deal, 2002 earnings should fall into the $3.80 to $3.90 a diluted share range, Fayne said. A Thomson Financial/First Call poll of 13 analysts puts 2002 earnings at $3.88 a diluted share. 
To achieve its longer term targets, AEP plans to lean heavily on its expanding wholesale trading operations. Currently, the company is the second largest wholesale electricity trader in the U.S. after Enron Corp. (ENE), and it ranks in the top ten in natural gas trading. 
The company expects to become a top-five natural gas trader as early as the fourth quarter this year, and to continue expanding electricity trading as the market evolves. And the company's aggressive growth plans shouldn't be deterred by current weakness in natural gas prices, or by wholesale power prices that are barely above generation costs in key U.S. markets, said Eric van der Walde, executive vice president of marketing and trading at AEP. 
The company continues to move into new markets and to use sophisticated analysis to devise market strategies, and because it isn't simply trying to sell electricity above cost, it isn't held back by sluggish markets, van der Walde said. 
""It's not negative for us to have markets where the prices are declining,"" he said. 
Fayne also noted that the performance at AEP's fleet continues to improve, which effectively adds more megawatts to its portfolio. Power plants in the company's eastern Midwest base, where it operates nearly 24,000 megawatts of power, ran at 91.8% capacity in 2001, up from 87.6% capacity a year ago. The company expects continued improvement for 2001. 
Aside from the U.K. power plant acquisition plan announced this week, AEP said it remains open to other future power plant purchases. Though the company doesn't believe it needs to always own power plants in areas where it markets power, like the West Coast, owning assets in those areas can still be helpful, said E. Linn Draper, AEP's president and chief executive. 
""We would be open to the idea of trading something here for something somewhere else,"" Draper said. ""Nothing is sacred in terms of the portfolio. Anything is fair game."" 
The company does plan in the near term to hold on to its large Cook nuclear plant, a 2,110-megawatt generator in Michigan that regained full operations at the beginning of 2001 after a three-year outage, Draper said. But because there has been so much consolidation in the nuclear power industry, the company is open to considering some method of outside management that might allow it to share resources with other nuclear utilities.

"PacifiCorp is probably responsible for the onslaught of these Email's.  Most of PacifiCorp's Merchant tags that moved energy from CA to CA at a generator bus already used the term ""NOR"".  In our attempts to improve the checkout process so we could see our Merchant's schedules by tag I requested a software change to allow us to start scheduling his tags that contained the ARef value of ""NOR"" (No Oasis Required).  We then asked him to continue to use it and requested that he inform all those he did business with to also use it on our line so we could schedule against it.  I was not thinking about nor remembered Business Practice #11 at the time we implemented this and didn't realize it would be an issue.  Since the notification, I did some research and found that no standard is being used for the use of ""Single Bus"".  18 were ""single buss"", 8 were ""single bus"", 6 were ""singlebus"".  I have made the attached programming change to comply with Business Practice rule and I believe that Mark is going to send a notice to everybody that the rule needs to be followed as written.    I apologize for the inconvenience, it was not intentional.   We will accept all tags that properly use ""Single Bus"".

The source  control area shouldn't have the fake transmission.  Guess part of the problem is due to CAs not registering as TPs which would  make things much more consistent.

Hi Anthony,

sorry for replying late. I'd like to chip in a brief experience report 
for our company.

We have used RUnit since 2003 starting with R 1.6.2 for our R software 
development. Since then it has been used for development for over a 
dozen packages with ~ 3k unit tests. Making use of S4 classes and 
methods with clear design contracts made its application even more 
fruitful. To automate the test process we utilized
Linux tools to tailor a build and test system to check our R packages 
with previous, current and development versions of R, CRAN and BioC 
packages to guarantee backward compatibility as far as possible whilst 
adapting to changes.

Over time the main benefits have been
  - fearless refactoring of major building blocks of our class hierarchy
  - early detection of and adaptation to changes in new R versions
  - data workflow integration testing
    starting with some data warehouse query initiated from R throughout
    to generated analysis reports using sweave or similar report
    generators.
    With this changes in the warehouse, R, some CRAN R package, our code
    or the report templates could be spotted and fixed
    well before any time critical analysis was due

rewarding the additional effort to write and maintain the tests.


Best regards,

   Matthias

"Hello,

I'm writing a script with 120 main items divided into 20 blocks of 6 items
each.  The thing is that each block of items is also attached to another
item (a comprehension question) about one of the original 6 items in the
block.

I'm able to get DmDX to scramble the items within the blocks, but is there
a way to get DmDX to also scramble the blocks so that the comprehension
question comes after the right block and always at the end of the block?

Currently I'm just scrambling within blocks and using the backslash before
each of the comprehension questions (and then creating random orders of
the blocks myself using Excel).

Second question: I keep getting an error message when I export data after
running the script, which looks something like

!  Error in subject number 1 marked by !!
!  Display error at msec 109941.44, tick 6575 in item 2, frame ""In""
!    moved into video memory 442 ticks late
!     (previous frame's duration will have been longer)

Does this error look like it's arising from an error in my script or some
faulty aspect of the hardware?

"Reiner's advice didn't work for me. It's true that the disk was full,
but clobbering some of the topic libraries didn't help matters. It
showed the same symptoms on reboot. (No X start, occasional screen

 I'm not sure how to ""capture"" log and get it to the world; apparently
my olpc can't see the network to scp anything. The best I can do is

Since I'm an olpc novice and not a Linux expert I am probably not the

Governor's greased lighting 
Davis criticized for accepting money from power companies
 
Sacramento -- After having sworn off campaign contributions from energy companies, Gov. Gray Davis has started taking money from power providers seeking to do business with the state. 

The two $25,000 contributions came during a series of fund-raisers the governor held when he made a trip last month to the East Coast to view the damage at the World Trade Center and Pentagon. 

The Democratic governor, who has raised more than $30 million for his re- election campaign, has been criticized for taking money from groups that have interests before the administration. 

Yesterday, Davis defended the decision to take the money, saying the worst of the energy crisis is behind us. 

""My concern was in not taking money from people who were actively selling us power during the difficult early months in 2001,"" he said of his decision in January to stop taking contributions from utilities and power companies. ""To my knowledge neither of those companies are active players in that process. "" 

But consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield blasted Davis for accepting the money and said it should be returned. 

""If it was dirty money before, it is even dirtier now,"" said Rosenfield, who heads the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. Davis is mistaken to think that the energy crisis is over, Rosenfield said. 

""Tell that to the 20 million Californians who have seen their rates increase an average of 50 percent,"" he said. 

The two companies -- FPL Energy LLC and Caithness Energy LLC -- each gave $25,000 to Davis' campaign fund. 

Both contributors have proposed projects pending in California. 

Caithness Energy, a New York-based generator, is expected to file plans to build a power plant with the California Energy Commission later this month. The company wants to build a 560-megawatt natural gas fired plant in Riverside County. 

And subsidiaries of FPL Energy, a Florida generator that operates power plants across the country, are in negotiations with the state's new Power Authority to construct wind turbines in Southern California. The state would buy energy from the turbines and have the option to own them. 

In addition, Caithness and FPL are working together to building another power plant in Riverside County. That project was approved by the state's Energy Commission in March. 

Garry South, Davis' political adviser, said the campaign's position had not changed with regard to collecting money from energy interests. 

South said that the two companies had not been gouging the state and that the fact they had business pending with the state was irrelevant. 

""It is not against the law to take money from a company that does business with the state,"" he said. South said the contributions had no bearing on any decisions made. 

 
 
India Dabhol Project Due Diligence To Start Next Week
 
NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Prospective buyers of the 85% foreign equity in India's 2,184-megawatt Dabhol Power Co. will start due diligence of the project next week, A.K. Doda, executive director of Industrial Development Bank of India (P.IDB), told Dow Jones Newswires Friday. 

The possible buyers are Tata Power Co. Ltd. (P.TPW) and BSES Ltd. (P.BSX) 

""After the due diligence is completed, price negotiations will start and thereafter, the transfer of shares and transfer of ownership will take place,"" Doda said. 

U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) has a controlling 65% equity stake in Dabhol and wants to sell it because of payment defaults by the plant's sole customer - the Maharashtra State Electricity Board - and the Indian federal government's failure to honor payment guarantees. In August the U.S. company said it was willing to sell its equity at cost. 

Dabhol is India's largest single foreign investment to date. MSEB has 15%, while U.S.-based companies General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel (X.BTL) own 10% each in DPC. 

""The share price of the shareholding of Enron and its associates in DPC would be decided by the concerned parties, through mutual negotiations. Indian financial institutions propose to continue their efforts to ensure quick resolution of all issues at the earliest,"" Doda said. 

Doda denied local media reports saying that India's state-owned firm National Thermal Power Corp. (P.NTP) was also a potential buyer of the foreign equity in Dabhol. 

""So far, I am aware of only two companies - Tata Power and BSES. NTPC haven't sent us any expression of interest yet for the Dabhol project,"" he said. 


Ontario mulls alternative to Hydro deregulation
 
The planned deregulation of the $35-billion Ontario electricity sector has been thrown in doubt by a radical proposal that would shackle the province's electricity transmission company, preventing it from becoming a significant player in an open North American power market. 

The plan, known only to Ontario Premier Mike Harris and a few government and Bay Street insiders, would turn Hydro One into a not-for-profit entity instead of a fully commercial, privatized company. If this happens, Hydro One would lack the flexibility to raise equity capital, make acquisitions and form partnerships in an effort to become one of continent's premier transmission companies -- a goal plainly set out by chief executive officer Eleanor Clitheroe. 

David Lindsay, the president and chief executive officer of Ontario SuperBuild Corp., the government's privatization adviser, confirmed that turning Hydro One into a not-for-profit organization, similar to Nav Canada, the civil air navigation service, is under serious consideration. 

""We've been asked to evaluate all options for Hydro One's future, including this one,"" he said yesterday. 

He would not provide details, though it is thought that the government wants to make a decision on Hydro One's future ownership structure by the conclusion of the year. 

A senior official in the Ontario government, who did not want to be identified, said the proposal ""is a step backward to the old days of Ontario Hydro."" He was referring to the debt-laden utility that was split into Ontario Power Generation, the electricity generating arm, and Hydro One, whose network of high-voltage transmission lines spans 30,000 kilometres. 

The Premier's office would not comment. A spokeswoman for Energy Minister Jim Wilson would say only that ""there are a number of options on the table."" 

Sources on Bay Street and at Queen's Park said the idea of turning Hydro One into a not-for-profit entity is being propelled by Anthony Fell, the chairman of Royal Bank-owned RBC Dominion Securities, Bay Street's largest dealer. If the new Hydro One took this shape, it would raise about $10-billion through the sale of bonds to investors. 

The dealers' commission on the sale of the bonds, which would rank among the biggest debt issues in history, would range from $25-million to $40-million, one Bay Street executive said. 

Mr. Harris is said to be keen on the concept partly because all the money would go back to the government to help pay down the $21-billion in ""stranded debt"" racked up by the old Ontario Hydro. The generating and transmission giant's decades-long spending spree on nuclear plants and other assets tore a huge hole in the province's balance sheet. 

Hydro One's cash flow, derived from sales to electricity users, would be used to pay the interest on the $10-billion of bonds. Presumably, consumers would face higher electricity charges if Hydro One lacked sufficient cash to pay the interest. If Hydro One were a private company instead, its financial risk would be borne by shareholders, not ratepayers. The United States has embraced deregulation partly because it shifts the financial risk of the electricity market from taxpayers to shareholders. 

Executives at RBC Dominion declined to comment on the plan, citing client confidentiality concerns. Mr. Fell first proposed it to the government in the spring. 

The government wants to open up the Ontario electricity market, in which buyers and sellers can negotiate prices, by next spring. The market overhaul contemplated turning Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One, both of which are 100 per cent owned by the government, into commercial companies. In Hydro One's case, the leading options were thought to be an outright sale, in which the utility would be bought by another company (presumably a rival utility), or an initial public offering, where the shares would be owned by private investors and traded on the stock exchange. 

The third option -- converting Hydro One into a not-for-profit organization -- has come as a surprise. There has been no debate on this option, though rumours of its existence have jolted Bay Street and Hydro One, both of which were working on the assumption that the transmission business would eventually become a commercial enterprise. 

Sources said that Hydro One management opposes the not-for-profit structure because it would deny Hydro One the flexibility and discipline of a typical commercial business. The not-for-profit structure would mean it would not have to pay taxes, which raises potential trade issues with the United States. American transmission companies might argue that Hydro One's non-taxable status gives it an unfair competitive advantage. 

It would also deny Hydro One management the benefit of potentially lucrative share options. 

Rod Taylor, Hydro One's executive vice-president, would not comment on the not-for-profit option being contemplated by the government. He said, however, that the company's strategy hinges on its ability to become a major player in the deregulated North American electricity market. ""Our vision of the company is to become a fully commercial entity, and become in the transmission sector what Canadian National is to the rail sector,"" he said in a phone interview. 

Stanley Hartt, the chairman of the Canadian office of Wall Street's Salomon Smith Barney, is among the Bay Street executives who opposes a not-for-profit structure for Hydro One (Salomon has a small role as an adviser to Hydro One's strategic business plan). 

In a three-page letter sent this week to the top executives of several large power-using Ontario companies, he said that ""this idea is short-sighted and bad for Ontario."" 

He argued that ""the absence of an equity component in the capital structure of the not-for-profit corporation essentially transfers the equity risk to the ratepayers."" He also said that, without financial flexibility, Hydro One would lack the resources to invest in ""new bottleneck-eliminating connections"" that would allow the company to become a significant electricity exporter. ""Ontario would lose the prospect of becoming a true hub for North American Energy transmission,"" he said. 

In a recent report on the power industry, TD Newcrest analyst David McCracken wrote, ""With its operating expertise and strong balance sheet, Hydro One is well positioned to act as a consolidator of transmission grids in the northern United States, where ownership tends to be fragmented."" 

He noted that Hydro One is expected to be privatized in the next few years, and he said the utility has ""the opportunity to lever strengths from traditional wires businesses into competitive high-growth initiatives."" 

According to sources familiar with the not-for-profit proposal, Hydro One would be governed in the best interests of all electricity users by stocking the board of directors with appointees from corporations that are heavy power users, such as auto and steel makers and paper companies. Such a structure exists at Nav Canada, with airline executives on the board, and the company has been able to cut the fees it charges customers. 

Restructuring Hydro One with debt, rather than equity, is also presented as the most efficient way to capitalize the company. 

""The problem with a Canadian National Rail-style IPO is that equity is much more expensive than debt,"" said one financier familiar with the proposal. ""With a debt-based structure, every dollar earned is available to pay interest, while an equity-based structure means you pay federal taxes, provide a return to shareholders and make debt payments."" 

Dofasco Inc., the big Ontario steel producer that consumes about $100-million of electricity a year, supports the not-for-profit proposal. Gord Forstner, head of communications, said a bond sale would reduce Ontario Hydro's stranded debt by $10-billion immediately, paving the way for lower electricity charges. Currently, a special levy on all electricity bills is being used to whittle down the debt. The charge costs Dofasco alone about $15-million a year. 

""We want to see the stranded debt paid down first,"" Mr. Forstner said. ""Until that happens, we don't favour Hydro One going to the expense of expanding outside of Ontario's boundaries."" Hydro One at a glance 

Ontario's electricity transmission system split off from the former Ontario Hydro in May, 2000. It is the largest power distribution network in Canada and serves 1.2 million people.

"summary of the activities since friday :
overall , it ' s 50 - 50 or better that the legislature will finish up the budget and recess until august 20 th , without having passed some form of an "" edison mou . "" will have a better view of the chances of getting an mou agreed to and passed through both houses by cob monday .
in the senate :
the "" edison mou "" :
as previously reported , on friday , sb 78 - - - the senate ' s version of the edison mou - - passed out of the full senate and was sent to the full senate .
the bill sticks 100 % of suppliers ' debts with edison ' s shareholders but pays qfs and other creditors .
the authors believe that suppliers can ' t force edison into bankruptcy because the claims are with the px , not edison , which in their view means that the suppliers can ' t reach edison . our lawyers need to assess whether the tactic is strong from a legal perspective .
the bill creates an option to buy the transmission system , but rejects the goernor ' s mou , which buys it outright .
though there ' s some uncertainty , the bill appears to end direct access .
information we have indicates that the assembly does not support and will not pass sb 78 in its current form .
enron ( and the marjority of market participants ) opposes 78 .
the "" dunn investigation "" :
dunn released his report regarding contempt charges against enron on saturday .
the report recommends that the senate fine us , beginning with $ 1 , 000 the first day , and doubling everyday thereafter until enron "" complies . ""
dunn announced on saturday that he would attempt to bring the report to the full senate for a vote on saturday .
in response , our lobbyist in sacramento spoke to a leader of the republican party in the senate ( ross johnson ) , and persuaded johson to negotiate the date of the vote with burton and dunn .
she was successful - - - johnson went to burton and got him and dunn to agree not to vote on the report until the senate returned from its recess on august 20 th .
if the senate returns early , it could vote prior to the 20 th , but the likelihood of that happening appears low at this time .
the budget :
the senate passed the budget at about 1 am sunday morning .
the senate adjourned for recess after the vote and is not expected to return until august 20 th .
that leaves the assembly alone in sacramento to do its part regarding the budget and the edison mou .
the assembly
in short , leadership within the assembly is extremely weak and without much influence over its own party - - the democrats .
the speaker is viewed as having botched both the budget and the energy issue .
unable to do a deal , the assembly recessed saturday night and has not reconvened .
it has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget .
the assembly also has not passed its version of an edison mou , which it says it intends to do .
best information we have right now is that the assembly does not plan to go back into session until tuesday morning .
late saturday night , the assembly speaker released yet another version of his edison mou ( ab 82 xx ) , but it does not appear at this time that he has enough votes among assembly democrats to pass it .
enron - - together with business customers - - opposes the version of 82 xx released on saturday night because it does not adequately ensure direct access .
best ,

Well, just off the top of my head, when you say ""get 16 vac out"" how are
you determining this, a volt meter set for ""Volts AC"" or some such?  Not,
say, an oscilloscope?  You will note that almost all meters render ""AC
Voltage"" as the RMS (Root Mean Square) voltage.  That is to say, it is
sqrt(2)/2 the peak to peak voltage.  However, when you rectify and low
pass an AC waveform without any much load, you get approximately the peak
to peak voltage of the AC waveform as a DC level, minus twice the forward
voltage drop of the particular diodes you have chosen for your rectifier.

For example, 16 VAC = (16 / (sqrt(2)/2)) = 22.7 VDC.  Assuming you are
using a rectifier built with silicon diodes, (which have a .7 volt forward
drop across them) you would measure 22.7 - (2 * .7 ) = 21.3 volts DC.
Now, as to why you are getting lower then that, I would have to suggest
that the cap you are using has a high leakage current, and thus tends to
pull down your output voltage.  It might also have been damaged with the
application of more then it's rated voltage.
Is it perhaps one of those light blue bodied Panasonic electrolytics?
They are awful, but cheap.

My friends,

It is with some regret that I must tell you that I am leaving EBS & Enron as of Aug. 15th.  I have learned a lot during my long tenure at EBS.  Admittedly, some of what I've learned is how not to start a business; but I've also learned numerous positives around teamwork, management, setting goals, and defining new product markets.  All in all, I have definitely come out of the experience enriched.

What I regret the most is having to leave all of you.  I believe very strongly in the role of good people in achieving greatness.  And I have worked with some very brilliant, creative people while at EBS.  All of you have, in one way or another, enriched my life and work.  I really appreciate that.  

If I had a single wish before I left, I would like for Enron to better understand that to achieve greatness as a company, it is not sufficient to ""will"" it to occur.  At a minimum, it requires the right people, with the right skills, and the right knowledge, in the right area, and at the right time.  The key emphasis here is people.  People can't guarantee success; but they are a necessary prerequisite.

I will continue to be available till the 15th to transition any projects, knowledge, or whatever people need.  And after the 15th, I will be around from time-to-time on a consulting basis with various Enron groups.  My current plan is to stay in the Houston area for the foreseeable future, primarily consulting and working with various organizations to support entrepreneurship in the area. Please feel free to contact me at any time to talk on any topic.


I'll leave you with one of my favorite quotes:

	""We cannot direct the wind, but we can adjust the sails""

Thank you.

	-larry

At this point in time we need to avoid doing anything which will require any filing with FERC or which will jeopardize the power marketing certificate.

Marcus --

I would recommend that Enron not do anything to modify the Clinton MBR tariff at FERC right now.  It may make sense for Sam Behrens to work up a ""clean up"" filing to be ready to go upon any action.

Pls give me a call if you want to discuss or would like us to take a different approach.

"A Performance Comparison of Multi-Hop Wireless Ad Hoc Network Routing
Protocols.
Josh Broch, David A. Maltz, David B. Johnson, Yih-Chun Hu, and Jorjeta
Jetcheva. 

the main contribution of this paper is to compare main routing
algorithms in the same environment for the first time. this will
illustrate the relative performance of different algorithms and helpful
for choosing a algorithm in the later real  implementation.

the paper extends the NS2 simulator in the term of physical layers and
MAC layer and compare four routing algorithms, DSDV, TORA, DSR and AODV.
the relatively more accurate physical link and MAC layer modeling is
another contribution of this paper.

the metric used by this paper is delivery ration, routing overhead, path
optimization. the latency is counted. further, the routing overhead only
counts the number of packets. the paper does not argue why different
length of packets does not make a big difference.

the result shows that
1. dsr and aodv has a stable and better packet delivery ratio while DSDV
can not converge when pause time less than 100s and TORA drops too many
packets when network has 30 data sources.

2. dsr has lest routing overhead because of its cahcing from forwarded
and promiscuously overhead packets and non-propagating request. DSDV is
a proactive protocol so it has constant overhead regardless of the node
mobility.

3.DSDV and DSR almost always use shortest path regardless of pause time
while TORA and AODV do this only at large pause time.

4. when counting the length of control packets, AODV has lest number
while DSR performs still better than the other two algorithms.

in a summary, though this paper gives us an idea how those algorithms
perform relatively. it is still hard to say some one is better than
others because of limited scenarios simulated by the paper. Just as
admitted in the paper, it not comparable between this paper and
Freisleben and Jansen's because of different speeds of nodes and number
of nodes.

"Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.

       Morning Market View(TM) for Monday, October 22, 2001
                       as of 9:30AM EDT
 Information provided by Schwab Center for Investment Research 

================================================================

LACKLUSTER PREMARKET ACTIVITY

Stocks were poised to open flat to lower in the absence of any 
significant economic news until mid-week, amid primarily 
cautious earnings news. Earnings season resumes this week as 
roughly 160 of the S&P 500 companies will report, according to 
First Call.

Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing (MMM,102) reported 3Q operating 
earnings of $1.10 per share, $0.01 higher than the First Call 
mean estimate as global sales declined 7%. The Dow component 
said profits fell 12.4% from the year ago period mainly due to a 
slowing U.S. economy. Going forward, 3M lowered its 4Q earnings 
guidance to a range of $0.95-$1.05 per share, versus its 
previous $1.05 forecast.

Wireless, data communications and phone service provider SBC 
Communications (SBC,44,f2) posted 3Q profits, excluding items, 
of $0.59 per share, $0.01 below the First Call consensus 
estimate as business conditions worsened in recent months. The 
Dow component plans to cut capital expenditures by 20% in 2002 
and eliminate several thousand jobs as it attempts to achieve 
""meaningful growth in 2002.""

Dell Computer (DELL,24,f1) and EMC Corp. (EMC,11.51,f2) 
announced a five-year alliance aimed at growing both companies' 
storage system segments. The companies have agreed to co-market 
EMC's CLARiiON enterprise storage systems line in an effort to 
broaden Dell's storage presence, while enabling EMC to better 
position itself in the Windows NT and 2000 storage segments. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

Bonds were narrowly higher as stocks adopted a mixed to slightly 
negative tone in premarket activity. The economic picture this 
week doesn't heat up until Wednesday's release of the Fed's 
Beige Book at 2:00 p.m. EDT.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

European trading was mixed with computer-related, telecom and 
energy stocks leading the Bloomberg European 500 Index narrowly 
higher, up 0.46% as of 8:54 a.m. EDT. Energy stocks were boosted 
by heightened speculation that OPEC stands ready to cut 
production in anticipation of increasing global crude 
inventories through Q4 2001 and Q1 2002. The euro was softer 
against the dollar amid concerns that the hawkish European 
Central Bank's monetary policy has been less stimulative than 
that of the Fed's in the U.S.

Asian markets were mixed, but Japan's Nikkei-225 Index eked out 
a slight gain, up 0.25% at the close. Retail, pharmaceutical and 
export stocks were among the best performers, while banking 
shares led the declines. Select technology shares were also 
softer after a weekly report showed that DRAM prices had slipped 
below $1 as manufacturers struggled to trim inventories. The yen 
was lower against the dollar after Japan's All Industries Index 
declined 0.2% in August from the prior month, reflecting 
deteriorating economic conditions even before Sept. 11.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the December Globex futures contract as of 8:54 a.m. EDT, the 
S&P 500 Index was up 0.5 points (2 points below fair value), 
while the Nasdaq 100 Index was flat. The December DJIA futures 
contract was down 13 points (26 points below fair value), and 
the November crude oil futures traded on the NYMEX were down 
$0.04 at $21.79/barrel.

Below are my additional  comments:  1.  The reference to ""Hardware Products"" needs to be deleted, as does the  Schedule B.  It is my understanding that the hardware is provided by a  different vendor.  If it is necessary to reference the hardware as a  requirement for running the software programs, this should be listed in  Schedule A as a specification.  2.  Paragraph 2.1 - the term ""its best efforts"" should be replaced with  ""reasonable efforts"" and, if it is Quallaby's position that Enron pursue  confidential treatment of the information, despite legal requirements to  disclosed placed on Enron, the reasonable cost for pursuing this protection  should be borne by Quallaby.  3.  Paragraph 3.2 - the change made at the end of the paragraph needs to  read ""... BUT SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE  INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF SECTION 3.1(a) AND 3.1(b) ABOVE.""  Since neither  of the referenced provisions are, themselves, warranties, it is incorrect  to reference them in 3.2 as being warranties.  4.  Paragraph 3.3 - the following language should be inserted after the  word ""applications"" - ""save and except for any indemnity obligations of  Quallaby set forth in Section 3.1 above.""  By not having this reference, it  is possible that section 3.3 could be read to negate Quallaby's obligations  as set out in Section 3.1.  5.  In Section 5 of the Agreement - a new paragraph should be added as  paragraph 5.9 to indicate as follows:  ""The provisions of Sections 2, 3 and  4 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.""  This is  more so important now that Quallaby has included specific provisions  enabling it to terminate the agreement upon a threat of an infringement  claim.  With changes in the areas indicated above incorporated into the agreement,  we are prepared to move this matter forward.  Thanks for your continued assistance and cooperation.

The servos which I've been using can run at two different power levels...
I think they are 7.5 and 5 volts.  I found that if I powered the servo
directly off the battery (stupid, yes), the servo would over-correct and
jitter.  But if I powered if off of one of the digital inputs, which I
think provide 5 volts, the servo settled down and behaved properly.
Messing around with sonar a sonar ranger also seemed to indicate that
servos are sensative to power fluctuations and I think the regulated
power of the digital inputs is more stable, too.

What a cutie!  Will I be able to see her in person on the 28th?  You are
welcome to bring her!

Are you still up for next Sunday.  If so....ya'll could plan on coming at
12:30 or so.  We can cook out and also take a tour of the canals on our
little boat if ya'll are up for it and ...... if the weather cooperates.
If Erin isn't ready for her boat rides we can take turns going!

John and I have to go to Memorial City that night for a opening party.
It's casual, but we would need to start getting ready around 4 or so!

What do you think?

"Okay, now that I have re-read this and understand what Pat is suggesting, the answer is no we (benefits) can't speak to past practices since we were never part of the past practice.  What I need you to do is assist to make sure that the new practice planned that is being applied by Irma Alvarez's group is consistent with the plan document.  As you and I have discussed, we need to take this in the form of an administrative guideline to the admin. committee for them to bless as well.  

The various heads of HR and the legal group who worked with each HR person on severance will have to speak to past practice.  

As it relates to service, I would like you and Pat to have a discussion about the break in service rules and the interpretation of the word severance in the plan.  If Pat can't help, try Carol Jewett.   Benefits (and its ERISA attorney) need to provide the interpretation of the plan document for those that administer the plan.  We need to do everything possible to help everyone with the development of a tool that accurately calculates the plan benefits per the plan document.  If the document is lacking then we need to fix it (ASAP).  I am not a believer in vague language that is subject to multiple interpretations.  

Thank

Michelle, since the Plan is not administered centrally, it can be a challenge to learn what past practices were, especially if they differed from different work groups.  I've have always recommended centralized administration because an ERISA plan is required to be administered uniformly and consistently in similar circumstances.   
One place to check about past practices is Cynthia Barrow's group.  You may not know what all past practices were until the conclusion of discovery related to litigation.   
I don't know what past practices were, but I would start with Cynthia's group which I view as the source and reference point as to what the recommended practices should be.

"Hi everyone,

I'm a graduate student of engineering, lately introduced with R. and using R
for my project and thesis. I'm trying to use R for implementing a neural
network regression model and apply it to my database. I found three R
packages (""AMORE"" , ""grnnR"" , ""neural"") in R website, but their manuals are
not really user-friendly in my idea. I was wondering if anyone has a written
code in R using any of these packages for a feed-forward back-propagation
neural network in R that I can use it. That'll be a remedy for my nightmare
which already took quite time from me.
I would really appreciate it.

Sincerely,
Jason.

and will be phased out by year's end, with the exception of Jornada 720, which

Subject:	Market Risk Management Changes under New Risk Management Policy

To:	The Enron Management Committee


The Enron Corp. Board of Directors approved a new Risk Management Policy (the ""Policy"") on August 14, 2001, and notice has been distributed to Enron employees to announce the posting of this policy on the Enron intranet website at http://home.enron.com/resources (without market risk limits due to confidentiality).  The Policy includes a three page Executive Summary providing an overview of risk management practices for the four major types of risks addressed: (a) market risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk and (d) liquidity/funding risk, and this summary is attached to this e-mail for your convenience.  The credit policy was incorporated without change, and the Transaction Approval Process and Guarantee Approval Processes were also incorporated with updating for specific approval authorities. 

This e-mail message is being sent to the Enron Management Committee to highlight some key aspects of the Company's market risk management practices which may be of interest.  

The Policy established a new Risk Management Committee, members of which are the Chief Risk Officer and any others designated by the CEO of Enron Corp.  During this transition period, existing Commodity Group Limits as of August 14th remain in effect, and Enron Business Unit Limits are assigned accordingly.  These limits may be further adjusted by the Risk Management Committee and the CEO, and your market risk managers will be working with you to review the limit structure for your business unit's activities to facilitate compliance with the Policy and your business initiatives.  RAC is currently working with Global Risk Management Operations to develop appropriate risk reporting that meets the Policy requirements and the needs of business unit management.  

Regards,
Cassandra Schultz
Vice President, RAC

Summary of Changes to Market Risk Management Practices

In addition to consolidating Enron's various risk management policies and procedures into one comprehensive Policy, some substantive changes and clarifications were made to the Company's market risk management practices, as summarized below.  

1.	Increased the VaR Limit for the Trading Portfolio, providing discretion to the Enron Corp. CEO (""CEO"") to allocate such VaR limits within defined parameters
2.	Established an Expected Tail Loss Advisory Limit for the Trading Portfolio
3.	Revised the Market Risk Limit Structure within each Portfolio to delegate more discretion for individual Business Unit and Commodity Group limits to the CEO and Risk Management Committee
a)   Concentration VaR Limits approved by Board of Directors 
b)   Business Unit VaR Limits approved by CEO / Risk Management Committee
c)   Commodity Group Limits for each Business Unit approved by CEO / Risk Management Committee
d)   Trader/Desk Limits approved by Business Unit Office of the Chairman


Key Points re: the Limit Structure
1.	Concentration Limits are established on 6 large buckets of commodity groups; this bucketing focuses on market indicators from a Board perspective, not according to Enron's organizational structure; 
�	1) Americas Gas, 2) Americas Power, 3) European Gas & Power, 
4) Products, 5) Financials, and 6) Emerging Businesses
o	Examples:  Americas Power Concentration Limit includes Global Risk Markets; Financials Concentration Limit includes Credit; Appendix A of the Policy lists the individual Commodity Groups comprising each Concentration Limit
2.	CEO/Risk Management Committee has discretion to allocate the Trading Portfolio VaR limit among the Enron Business Units, subject to the Concentration Limits approved by the Board
3.	Expected Tail Loss is a new risk metric, and accordingly, an advisory limit is established only at the total Trading Portfolio level; some Commodity Groups may have the measurement calculated in RisktRAC, but no limit is set
4.	Business Unit VaR Limits are to be set for each Enron Business Unit (i.e. Enron Americas, Enron Global Markets, Enron Europe, etc. - any Business Units recognized as having authority for trading by the CEO)
5.	Commodity Group Limits are now to be set at a Business Unit level, representing the individual Business Unit's authority for trading specific commodities
�	every Business Unit shall have a Commodity Group Limit for any commodities for which they are authorized to trade; 
�	these Commodity Group Limits and corresponding risk reporting will enable top management and the Risk Management Committee to quickly understand risk parameters on a ""pure"" commodity group basis within each Enron Business Unit;
6.	Each Enron Business Unit OOC can establish Trader/Desk Level Limits and/or related risk reporting as they require, enabling them to view their trading results the way they manage their business (i.e., the same trader may actually trade more than one commodity, and therefore wish to view risk parameters for several commodities combined, etc.)

Risk Management Benefits of Limit Structure: 1) CEO flexibility below the Concentration Limit level, and 2) individual Enron Business Units have clearly defined trading authority, enabling the Risk Management Committee to authorize business units to trade in the same commodities while strengthening risk management practices to facilitate compliance with the Board approved Concentration Limits 

Limit Monitoring and Reporting
1.	All position and VaR violations are triggered at 100% of the respective limit
2.	All Daily Loss notifications are triggered at 100% of the VaR limit
3.	All Cumulative 5-day Loss notifications are triggered at 225% of the VaR limit 
4.	Trading Portfolio limit monitoring reported to the Board
5.	Concentration limit monitoring reported up to the CEO, and at Board meetings
6.	Business Unit and Commodity Group limit monitoring reported up to the Risk Management Committee
7.	Trader/Desk Level Limits and related reporting to be established by each business unit

Overall Portfolio Structure
�	Expanded the Trading Portfolio includes all of Enron's mark-to-market trading activity, including speculative trading of PGE and ETS 
�	Merchant Portfolio does not have established limits
�	Clarified that the Capital Portfolio is to capture and manage all positions related to Enron's capital structure; the VaR limit established is a Concentration Limit for Enron stock related transactions; as other positions are captured and measured, additional limits may be established as needed
Added a new ""Regulated"" Portfolio for certain transportation and distribution activities (a VaR limit was established by the Board for PGE's regulated activities)
�	Added a new ""Other Assets & Contracts"" Portfolio to capture and manage accrual or other type of positions not otherwise captured in the other Portfolios; no limits established

"Hi All, I have some question about COT and I would appreciate any input from you. When I wrote a script for an fMRI experiment, I put the following lines between the parameter lines and the items:     $     0 ""READY"";       100  c;     101  %1 /  %1/ ""READY"" /;     $ And here is what I got from the azk file (2072.85, +Bit1 are the RT & the button name): ****     Item 1046, COT 0.00, 2072.85      2072.85,+Bit1     Item 2008, COT 11689.17, 2260.07      2260.07,+Bit1     Item 1042, COT 23560.73, 1900.66      1900.66,+Bit1     .... **** I knew it today that I should have included 101 as an item, and that line should look like this:     +101 *  %1 /  %1/ ""READY"" /;"" and the azk file should start with something like below:      Item 101, COT 0.000 (and some RT)     Item 1046, COT 13513.02 (and some RT) I will correct this in my future script, but I want to understand my error better, so here are the questions: In my experiment, the fMRI scanner won't start collecting data until 12 seconds after the spacebar of the computer is hit (to start DMDX).  Since SOAs (relative to scanner data collection) instead of COTs are needed in image processing, the usual way to translate a COT value to an SOA value is to subtract 12 seconds from each COT value.   1) Where in the line does the scanner start?    %1 /  %1/ ""READY"" /; 2) Except for the first item, is my azk file really different from the ""should-be"" azk file? The following two questions are related to Question 1: 3) The presentation computer I used has a refresh rate of 16.58 ms, so I actually put a little bit more than 12 seconds on item 101.  I guess the scanner had started collecting data before the ""COT=0.00"" time point in my azk file.  Am I right?   4) If I still want to use the data that I collected (I collected two pilot subjects with this script), should I correct my COTs?  I.e., should I add 5.92 ms, 4.92 ms, or 3.92 ms to each of the COT value, depending on when the scanner is started?  (I got the value of 5.92 ms by subtracting 12000 ms from 724x16.58 (= 12003.92) plus two %1's).   Sorry about so many questions.  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!!

The figures raise concerns about training and compliance programs, according to top officials at the Labor Department and the AFL-CIO. . . .

CIRCUIT AGREES WITH NLRB THAT PACIFIC BELL ILLEGALLY REFUSED TO BARGAIN Pacific Bell committed unfair labor practices by refusing to bargain with and provide relevant information to the Telecommunications International Union, which was in the process, later aborted, of merging with the Communications Workers of America, a federal appeals court rules (""Pacific Bell v. NLRB, ""D.C. Cir., No. 00-1039, 8/10/01). The District of Columbia Circuit finds substantial evidence supports the National Labor Relations Board's determination that Pacific Bell did not have a good-faith, reasonable doubt regarding TIU's authority to represent a unit of the company's service representatives in northern California. Rejecting Pacific Bell's argument that it was ""understandably uncertain"" as to which union was the bargaining representative, Judge Garland finds the memorandum of understanding between the two unions clearly stated that TIU was solely responsible for representing the workers at the time the company refused to bargain. Garland also rejects the company's contention that there was a dispute between the two unions as to which had authority to bargain for the unit. . . . Page A-6 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4p8c1d7_ UAW FILES NLRB PETITION FOR ELECTION AMONG 4,100 NISSAN WORKERS The United Auto Workers files a petition with the National Labor Relations Board seeking an election among some 4,100 production and maintenance employees at a Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. plant in Smyrna, Tenn. If the board can get an agreement between the company and the union, an election could be held in approximately 42 days, an NLRB official says. If a hearing is necessary, an election could be scheduled within 50 or 60 days of the petition's filing. This is the fourth attempt by UAW to organize the Nissan employees in Smyrna since production began at the plant in 1983. In 1989, the union lost an election by a vote of 1,622 to 711. In both 1997 and 2000 the union walked away from active organizing campaigns, according to Nissan. . . .

The WTI's preliminary reading for third-quarter 2001 is 100.47, down slightly from 100.50 in the second quarter and 100.71 in the first quarter (second-quarter 1976=100). ""The WTI is suggesting that wage inflation will remain just below 4 percent over the next few months,"" says economist Joel Popkin, whose consulting firm developed the quarterly measure for BNA. . . .

In a staff policy directive, Howard Radzely, acting solicitor of labor, disagrees with a decision of the Labor Department's Administrative Review Board holding that administrative law judges have subpoena power under the ERA's whistleblower provision. The board, he says, """"in dictum, ""reached the novel conclusion that administrative law judges possess the authority to issue subpoenas under"" the ERA ""despite the absence of any clear indication that Congress authorized their use in whistleblower proceedings."" A review by the solicitor's Fair Labor Standards Division determined that the board's conclusion ""is at odds with the principle that agencies possess subpoena authority only upon a clear grant of such authority by Congress,"" the directive says. ""Because the board's reasoning is erroneous,"" the Labor Department should not rely on its """"dictum"" in requesting subpoenas or responding to subpoenas in litigation before the department's adjudicative agencies,"" the directive says. . . . Page A-1 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4p8b0q6_ USE OF RACIAL SLUR DURING ELECTION DID NOT TAINT OUTCOME, COURT AFFIRMS An employee's use of a racial slur while waiting in line to vote in a representation election did not taint the election's outcome, the Sixth Circuit affirms, enforcing an order by the National Labor Relations Board requiring a Cleveland foundry to bargain with the United Auto Workers (""NLRB v. Foundry Div. of Alcon Ind. Inc., ""6th Cir., No. 00-5062, 8/9/01). The use of the slur in this case did not constitute an appeal by UAW or by Foundry Division of Alcon Industries Inc. to the racial prejudices of the employees, Judge Jones finds, ruling that the employer violated the National Labor Relations Act by refusing to bargain. . . .

"Mr. Lay,

I wanted to send you a short note and let you know that I am behind you, and I am remaining focused on the job ahead.

I also wanted to thank you for your candidness in answering questions and providing information during the All-Employee Meeting on Tuesday.  As you and the management team work through the issues, that we as a company face, I will be praying for you and the team that God will give you the strength to stand firm on the integrity that has made this company what it is today.

""The integrity of the upright guides them, but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity."" Proverbs 11:3

Sincerely,
Chad Corbitt

In essence, its 2 wks base pay per year of service PLUS 2 wks base pay per 10K of salary for an executed Waiver and Release. Do you see any issues with making the Montreal staff eligible for this plan? A general employee meeting is being held tomorrow to announce the roll out and Monday will be the 2 wk kick of the program when employees will receive more detail of the plan.

"" deals of the
week "" ( see below toshiba )
refurbs save
cash ! why hesitate getting the best value by getting the
exact same equipment , with original manufacturers warranty at a much
lower price . money back guarantee , if you are not satisfied
- valid for 7 days
only .
q :
what
is considered factory refurbished ?
a : there are lots of
things that can label items factory refurbished . some are so
frivolous , its laughable . but because consumer laws prevent
manufacturers from selling anything considered factory refurbished
as "" new "" , the second consumer gets the best deal . here are a few
examples :
manufacturers /
distributors are not allowed to export outside their territory /
country .
to avoid
"" disturbing "" the dealer / reseller channel in different
countries , manufacturers and distributors cannot export the
product , as new and therefore label it as refurb and reduce the
warranty .
most major retail
superstores offer a 30 - day money back guarantee on their
products and there are those consumers that just simply take
advantage of that . these items are returned to the manufacturer ,
inspected and repackaged like new .
items where the
box or casing was damaged in shipment , which are returned to the
manufacturer .
the item was
returned to the manufacturer because of a slight defect . the
part that was defective was replaced by the manufacturer , tested
and then repackaged just like new .
the item was
returned because of a minor cosmetic blemish on the casing that
was corrected .
demonstration
units are also considered factory refurbished . these units are
inspected , tested and repackaged .
the box was simply
opened . thats it !
brand new
overstocked items are also labeled factory refurbished .
all factory
refurbished products are inspected serviced by the
manufacturer then tested and repackaged to meet original product
specifications . all
merchandise is warranted by the original manufacturer
unless otherwise specified .

How is this any different from attaching an Infobot or A.L.I.C.E
through licq's console-hook?  People have been doing that for years,
and for over a decade in IRC and the MUDs.... and the one thing I think we've learned in all that time is that,
as a help-desk, it doesn't work.  People just don't like talking to
robots, especially when the robots, once confused, become imbeciles.
I think the humans may feel cheated, deceived and tricked when they
discover, as with the Seattle answer, that they are talking to a
machine; there's no real intelligence behind that simulated-friendly
and therefore empty 'thx'.AIML is clever and cute, but for /practical/ applications as a first
line of technical support?  It's been tried over and over, and while I
/also/ think that it /should/ work, for the most part, people won't
use it.  What's worse, as we make the NL processing more and more
clever, it only means it fails more dramatically; ALICE doesn't just
stumble a bit, it starts to drool.  And ALICE is the best we have.Like a Dalek: All very impressive when things are going well, but all
it takes to betray the chicken-brain inside is a towel over it's
ill-placed eye, or a spin off the metal surface ;)In all the prolog-based NL database query systems of the 1980's and
other later chatterbot helpdesk projects like Shallow Red, even
simpler tries like Ask Jeeves, people very quickly know they're
talking to a robot, and the queries anneal to short, truncated and
terse database-like verb-noun or just noun-keyword requests.  People are just too quick to adapt, and too impatient to forgive a
clunky interface, and for now, especially when the /average/ computer
user still can't type more than maybe 5-10wpm, NL is a painfully slow
clunky interface.Put it this way: Would you login, wake the bot and ask for the Seattle
weather, or would you do as we /all/ do and just click the weather
icon sitting there on your desktop?Just for fun, here's an interesting conversation between Shallow Red,
ALICE and Eliza as they decide to play the Turing Game:http://www.botspot.com/best/12-09-97.htm--

"P-code, I assume, stands for ""pseudo code.""  The P code represents 
tokenized op codes for a virtual machine interface.  First the source is 
COMPILED into an intermediate set of tokens or commands which are then 
INTERPRETED by the processor.  It's sort of like the old UCSD Pascal.

BRET SCHUNDLER'S TELEMARKETING SCAM:
REAL SHAME LIES IN HIS EFFORT TO MISLEAD SENIORS

McGreevey for Governor campaign director Steve DeMicco today stood by the 
campaign's radio ad exposing Republican Bret Schundler's attempt to mislead 
seniors on his property tax relief plan, and fired back at the Schundler 
campaign for its disingenuous plan to reduce their property taxes.

""Bret Schundler is doing a disservice to seniors in New Jersey with his 
statewide telemarketing campaign that is misleading voters,"" said DeMicco. 
""Within 72 hours of the calls promising a tax cut, he backed off the plan, 
saying there would not be any tax cuts next year. (Source:  Associated 
Press, 9/27/01)  To date, Mr. Schundler has yet to say just when his plan 
would be implemented.  Our seniors deserve better, and he ought to apologize 
to them for misrepresenting his plan for political gain.""

Last week, the McGreevey campaign began airing a radio ad exposing 
Schundler's scheme to mislead seniors. In recent weeks, Schundler launched a 
statewide phone-banking effort, calling seniors throughout the state 
promising a new property tax cut.  But, when questioned about the plan, 
Schundler backed off his proposals and admitted that there will be no tax 
cut next year.

DeMicco also lambasted the Schundler campaign for its TV and radio ads that 
have been criticized by the media.  The New York Times called his ads 
""misleading"" (10/20/01) and The Bergen Record called them a ""stretch"" 
(10/16/01), and charged that Schundler ""exaggerates"" his record  (9/26/01).

""Mr. Schundler has consistently distorted Mayor McGreevey's record and have 
at best misrepresented his own record - on taxes, on crime and on parkway 
tolls,"" DeMicco said.  ""The voters deserve straight talk, and it's clear 
that Jim McGreevey is the only candidate for governor who is putting forth a 
responsible plan to improve public schools, put drivers before auto 
insurance companies, provide real property tax relief, protect a woman's 
right to choose and to fight any effort to weaken New Jersey's tough gun 
laws. That's the kind of governor New Jersey deserves - not one who is going 
to make reckless promises just to get elected.""

Date: 2002-09-23T09:27:30-05:00No, really. My sinus infection, which appeared to be gone, flared up again over 
the weekend in the nastiest way, and I am now coughing up dark mucus and doing 
other things that probably don't bear repeating in a public forum. I have the 
10:15 doctor's appointment that I should have made last round, had I not 
convinced myself that â€œit's not that badâ€ and trudged through it 
all without prescription drugs. I'm not making the same mistake this time. I'll 
be back this afternoon. My email problems of yesterday have been resolved. You can once again reach me 
at my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. Kevin Burton[1] emailed me with another way to link to a FOAF file from my RSS 
feed. It looks easier than previous suggestions, and it has the advantage of 
being able to use it from an RSS 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but I worry about all these 
variations. Just as in real life, where people can use different words that 
mean essentially the same thing, in the Semantic Web programs can use different 
vocabularies to express the same statements. That's great for producers, not so 
great for consumers who have to make sense of it all. For each domain (RSS feeds, FOAF files, whatever), somebody (or some group) 
needs to come along and document best practices. We need better _goal-oriented_ 
documentation. We have a lot of reference documentation, task-oriented 
documentation, but very little that documents that larger picture and answers 
questions written in English. â€œHow do I include personal information in 
my RSS feed?â€ is a goal-oriented question. â€œCreate a FOAF file 
using this tool and then insert this line at this location in your RSS 
feedâ€ (with as many examples as necessary) is a goal-oriented answer. 
Anything less is like trying to master a foreign language by reading a 
dictionary.[1] http://www.peerfear.org/

You know it's stupid - I know it's stupid. Nonetheless, Microsoft has tried
to spread FUD about the viral nature of the GPL to make CEO/CIO level people
(often not the most technically clueful, even the CIOs) fear that if they so
much as use a Linux box, as, say, a print server, they'll have to make their
company's entire IP public. (I don't think Microsoft said precisely what I
jsut said, but that was the tenor of the remarks). And their marketing
budget is a tad bigger than yours or mine.

It's likely more important in languages where method names don't have to

When pcode is downloaded to the Handy Board, how much memory space does it take up?

I am a little concerned about having enough memory space for my programs. As I see it now, I think I may max out the 32KB. 

Does anyone have tips on how to concerve space. The only thing I can think of is to edit out some functions from lib_hb.c that I am not using, and also not loading the r22 IR files which I'm not using either.

(I think someone posted once about a similar problem and said that some space concerving was solved after using the commericial version of IC, how so?)

Thanks in advance,

Hi





Hi. 

 
I just
discovered the most amazing casino games site!

Right after
I made my deposit I got a $250 bonus, and it says I can get op 
to $1000 in free bonusses!

 
The
graphics are crisp and ubelievably realistic! I played live blackjack and
roulette – then I played slots and guess what.....I hit a $10,000
jackpot! Didn't believe it till I saw them on my account an hour ago. 


 
You
absolutely have to try it out!

entre adn et organisation cellulaire , qu ' en est-il de l ' embryogenese comme hermeneutique du vivant ? * quelle diffrence y a-t - il entre l ' interpretation par le vivant , l ' homme et la machine ? quels modeles en avons-nous et sont-ils conflictuels ? que nous apprend l ' ordinateur comme machine universelle a traiter le signe ? * quel est le role des conflits et antagonismes dans la construction d ' interpretation ? pourquoi les eviter et comment les utiliser ? * comment une interpretation individuelle est-elle possible ou qu ' en est-il de l ' interpretation collective et du role de la multiplicite des points de vue , qu ' ils soient methodologiques , contextuels ou de niveaux , et donc des conflits qui peuvent en resulter ? qu ' en est-il de l ' interpretation comme resolution des conflits et donc moteur d ' evolution ? * si , comme dans la deuxieme definition du greimas ( voir notes ) , les signes sont toujours deja signifiants , comment peuvent-ils avoir ce statut ? qu ' est-ce qui les rend signifiants ? qu ' en est-il de la pensee symbolique des civilisations anciennes ou orientales et qui a ete cultivee chez nous jusqu ' au moyen - age ( g . durand ) ? comment cette forme d ' interpretation s ' articule-t - elle avec les signes decontextualises , jusqu ' a etre calculables et a la conception de l ' interpretation qui en decoule ? * de quels processus de legitimation des interpretations disposons-nous ? quelles relations l ' interpretation entretient-elle avec l ' action ou l ' argumentation que ce soit avant , par ou apres coup ? comment l ' interpretation s ' articule-t - elle a la controverse , la negociation , l ' ajustement ? * puisque la simulation joue un role de plus en plus grand dans l ' activite du modelisateur : comment s ' articulent la simulation et l ' interpretation ? ces questions sont au coeur de la plupart des sciences et plus particulirement la semiotique , l ' hermeneutique , les sciences cognitives et neurosciences , la philosophie , la psychologie , la linguistique et psycholinguistique , l ' intelligence artificielle , l ' anthropologie et la sociologie . elles sous-tendent galement l ' activit scientifique , tant dans la modelisation que dans l ' exprimentation . elles sont inseparables des activites des concepteurs - ingenieurs , informaticiens , architectes . . . - dont les productions proviennent de la resolution de conflits d ' interpretations du monde , et sont soumises des conflits d ' interpretation . notes : selon "" semiotique - dictionnaire raisonne de la theorie du langage "" de greimas et courts , on distingue au moins deux acceptions de l ' interpretation , l ' interpretation comme attribution de significations des signes qui en sont depourvus et l ' interpretation comme paraphrase ( au sens large ) de signes deja remplis de significations . cette deuxieme acception fait echo au "" dictionnaire de la psychanalyse "" de laplanche et pontalies qui definit l ' interpretation comme degagement , par l ' investigation analytique , de sens latent dans le dire et les conduites d ' un sujet ; faisant donc reference a la fois au sens deja la et , en plus , sa modalite d ' obtention . soumission des contributions les propositions de communication , de 4 12 pages , devront parvenir en trois exemplaires ou sous forme electronique ( word attache vivement souhaite ) a l ' adresse suivante : christophe parisse , inserm , laboratoire de neuropsychologie de l ' enfant , batiment pharmacie 3eme etage , hopital de la salpetriere , 47 bd de l ' hopital , 75651 paris cedex 13 , france e - mail : parisse @ ext . jussieu . fr dates importantes reception des manuscrits : 31 septembre 1998 notification d ' acceptation : 9 novembre 1998 remise des versions finales : 10 decembre 1998

"Bob Shults and I will be attending an eNYMEX reception this Thursday, and John and Greg are still trying to coordinate a meeting with Bo and Vincent.  Short answer-- we've got it as covered as possible for now.  

Another item:  I got a call from Stephen Thome in ENA who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on EnronOnline.  Jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets.  I'm told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle, so to speak.  I think it fits well for the turbines, but I wanted to make sure you were behind this idea before we launched into development.

I am assuming that Greg Piper is going to handle this - you may want to talk to John Arnold as he has some good ideas for a deal with Nymex.

I would be happy to meet with them so feel free to set something up.  We have had contact in the past with NYMEX on some of these issues and I can explain the story later.

My asistant is Tina Spiller and I am in next week (I am in London this week) so maybe we can get together and discuss.

thanks.

I recently met Robert ""Bo"" Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and formerly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron.

With the additional caveat that this convergency towards a server's
anvil-like concurrency limit is implemented by having Postfix make
small concurrency adjustments after each delivery.

This limits the applicability of ""convergency to anvil-like
concurrency limits"" to scenarios where you're sending a steady
stream of email for a significant amount of time.  Otherwise, the
small concurrency adjustments won't have much effect at all.

ImageInfo and possibly some custom meta rules to add score when both

I agree they are probably inline images, I just wanted to confirm that

"Vince, I hope this e-mail finds you well.

The recent award of the Nobel Prize in Economics to Stiglitz, Spence and Akerlof  has set me thinking. Lots of what Enron does addresses asymmetrical markets by improving information. Is it a stretch to apply their theories to energy? Do our risk management tools help equalize the amount of information in the marketplace?

For example, Stiglitz says that insurance deductibles is the way that insurance carriers get customers to reveal their potential liability. Someone who is more likely to be in poor health or have accidents will seek lower deductibles. Do any of Enron's products help us, or the energy markets, reveal information that creates not only a more effective market but a market that works? 

If there is something substantial to this, I'd like to write about the subject for Exchange, the wholesale customer magazine. If it is just an interesting observation (that's true), perhaps we'd run it in eBiz.

Please take care,
Jeannie

Steve,
Back in June we discussed the issue of the SBAs' priority during an Allocation.  The Business Development group and Contracts are in the process of making the necessary changes so that CMS can distinguish ITs associated with SBA activity from other IT agreements and are second through the meter after Primary during allocations.  For your information, below are the comments from the various people involved in this issue

Please let us know if you have any further concerns regarding this issue.  Thanks for your continued help in this matter.

I believe Reyna, et al, have held discussions with the Reg Types and received the green light to go forward, but I will confirm. 

Regarding (2.), With the new contract system being developed, the monitoring of contract provisions via the system should be do-able. I am sure both CMS and TMS will be involved in the effort.

Subject:	SBA Priority during Allocations

Sue, 
During the meeting today with Gerry to discuss the SBA priority during allocations, some of the following issues came up:  (Gerry, correct me if I misunderstood anything)

If we ever call an SBA to bring in gas after the timely cycle, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible? (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority during the timely cycle).
If the SBAs bring in gas at a secondary point, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible?  (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority at Primary Points).
Are we aware that an Alternate shipper who has flowing rights from the previous day might get ""squeezed"" out of the same entitlement on a day that an SBA shipper is given priority over Alternate?  Might have some mad shippers.
How will SBA volumes be posted on the EBB if there is an allocation: Interruptible???
Because the current methodology for allocation is based on a ""point"", they don't follow the downstream, will the IT contracts currently being used have to be identified through the contracts department as ""SBA IT""?
This is for the future contracts system:  Should we ask that the new contract system to automate all the manual processes of the SBAs such as account balance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this criteria?

This sounds great, thank you.

This is encouraging, because a lot of the search results said otherwise. Good to know that things have improved.

I would rather use uswsusp and not patch the kernel.

Right now I have the following two packages installed: hibernate and uswsusp. The hibernate package description says that it supports both suspend2 and /sys/power/state. Am I correct to assume that uswsusp uses neither? I want to make sure ""just in case"" and because by default the laptop task installs hibernate. The last thing I need is a corrupt partition.

Thank you for the generous replies. They helped a lot!

"Orca and Gnome are both great products and I would encourage their use but, 
if your budget allows, you should probably purchase a DoubleTalk LT which is 
an external hardware synthesizer.  The desktop environment still has its 
quirks and if it unexpectedly dies you will be dumped into a shell, so best 
to have hardware speech if at all possible.  Insure that you have a serial 
port, though.

Please take just a few minutes to read the following message and then forward to others in your group.
 
Once again Mike McConnell has volunteered to be the chair of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) walk.  This year the walk will be held on Sunday, October 28, 2001, at Greenspoint Mall.
 
As some of you may know, Mike has diabetes and JDRF is an organization that is very important to him.  There are two types of diabetes and Mike has Type 1, insulin-dependent diabetes which is also known as Juvenile Diabetes.  The other type of diabetes is Type 2, adult-onset diabetes that can often be controlled with a combination of diet, exercise and oral medication.  Every day Mike must prick his finger to test his blood sugar at least 7 times, in addition to giving himself at least 3 or 4 injections of insulin.  Just think of it, at least 10 times a day Mike has to stick himself with a needle to manage his disease.  I don't know about you, but I am a wimp if I have to get a shot just once every few years and I can't even begin to imagine what it must be like to stick yourself over 70 times in just one week!  But for Mike it is not just one day or one week, it is every day of every week for the rest of his life -- until a cure is found.  Diabetics can never take a break from their disease.  It requires constant management of their food intake, monitoring of their blood sugar and the administration of the proper amount of insulin.  If diabetes is not properly managed it can lead to kidney disease or failure, blindness, heart disease, amputations, among other complications.
 
I wanted you all to know that I have volunteered to help Mike in his efforts with the JDRF walk again this year.  I am serving on the steering committee and I plan to walk again this year to raise funds to help find a cure for this terrible disease.  I am doing this to support Mike, but I also have a personal interest in doing whatever I can to help find a cure.  My husband has adult-onset diabetes and we lost his mom and her three sisters all to diabetes and diabetes-related diseases several years ago.  In addition, I have an uncle and a cousin that both have juvenile diabetes.
 
I am sending this message to ask you to join our team for the JDRF walk this year.  It would mean a lot to me (and to Mike) to have support from the people in our Enron Global Markets organization, as well as people from previous groups we have worked with, along with other friends throughout Enron.
 
Some of you receiving this message have already signed up and I want to take this opportunity to say thank you very much!  For those of you that have not yet signed up, please consider one of the following three opportunities that are available to give your support to this important effort:
1.      Team Leader.  The team leaders help solicit walkers and handle the collecting and reporting of funds raised by their group of walkers.  Based on the donations raised by your group, you may also be eligible for prizes available only to team leaders.  If you are interested in becoming a team leader, please contact me right away so that I may get the team leader information and materials to you. 
2.      Walkers.  If you want to sign up to walk and raise funds for JDRF, I will make sure that you get on one of our teams -- just sign up!  The JDRF walk is a very fun event with music, entertainment and great food.  All walkers are asked to raise at least $25 in donations and will receive a great T-shirt to wear the day of the walk. 
3.      Supporters.  If it just is not possible for you to join us for the walk on October 28th, then please sign up as a supporter by sending a return e-mail with your pledge amount and you will be contacted later in October for collection of the donation. 
The bottom line is raising money to support research to find a cure!  The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation is very well managed and for every dollar that is donated to JDRF, over 85 cents goes directly to research.  In addition, this year Enron will match all donations dollar for dollar.
 
Thank you for your support, time and efforts.  And please, let's Walk to Cure Diabetes!

I  reccently informed the author that there was a bug which counted lines
after __DATA__ as perl code.  I am not sure if that applies in this
situation but it added 10K SLOC to my project which was less than 2K without
it ;-)

Yes, you are right, after ""use warnings;"". I ran SA3.2 on my site with 
""use bytes;"" added, no problem so far. But it seems SA developers did not 
mention this, they might have their reasons (break normalize_charset for 
one reason).

My recommendation:

The Bay is overbought. I'm long-term short the Bay.  ;-)

Except for the increased personal existential risk, which is probably  
less than, say, driving a car --- I'd say that the prospective  
Washington gig sounds more intriguing;  that doesn't satisfy the  
child / education issue, though.  Hard to say what to do.

In general, I'm not much in favor of CS PhDs;  they're generally less  
than useful --- Russell's one of the only guys with one that I know  
that can actually still write code.  Seems to often ruin you for  
that.  And the world needs another treatise on a typed lambda  
calculus with ""novel"" concurrency mechanisms like it needs a hole in  
the head.

More useful than an MBA or yet another JD, but that's beside the  
point... ;-)

AI at Stanford, MIT, or CMU --- probably the biggest exceptions to  
that rule.  GMU is interesting;  perhaps there's some kind of multi- 
agent / economics / AI thing might fly, given the pool of advisors to  
tap there.  IMHO, once everybody else gets over the novelty of the  
""multi-core"" / parallel programming thing that we've all known was  
coming for over 20 years and realizes Erlang / join- or pi-calculus  
is the wellspring for the next 700*, then the intersection between  
game theory, economics, practical game playing, and heterogeneous  
multiple agent systems stuff is going to become the hot topic.  GMU's  
as ripe for groundbreaking work in that area as any place outside of  
Hebrew University in Jerusalem...

(Understand all this educational advice is from a guy that didn't  
have the patience to finish his undergrad... :-)

Get admitted, fire up the ole' grant-proposal-writing grammar / text  
generator, feed it a bunch of relevant things from citeseer, [1] and  
fund the W3C participation that way.  Or:  write a decent poker bot,  
buy some rack space in Anguilla, and fund it that way...

$0.02, YMMV.

* I reserve the right to be wrong about this.  Indeed, I *hope* I'm  
wrong about it.  I hope that the compiler writers can actually make  
concurrent Haskell a practicality for real-world systems.  It would  
be lovely if the argument for explicit concurrency was as moot 10  
years from now as the arguments against ""high-level languages like C""  
and the use of compilers was by 1980.

But Haskell isn't the right vehicle anyway;  the language designers  
need to get over the novelty and generality of monads, come back to  
earth, and realize that uniqueness types are the only way truly  
functional languages are going to make it in the mainstream.  Paul  
Graham be damned, there's more to be gained by doubling the  
productivity of the lower 90% than by increasing the productivity of  
the elite 10% by 10%.

Dear R-helpers,

I am planning a course on Statistical Computing and Computational
Statistics for the Fall semester, aimed at first year Masters students
in Statistics. Among the topics that I would like to cover are linear
algebra related to least squares calculations, optimization and
root-finding, numerical integration, Monte Carlo methods (possibly
including MCMC), bootstrap, smoothing and nonparametric density
estimation. Needless to say, the software I will be using is R.

1. Does anybody have a suggestion about a book to follow that covers
   (most of) the topics above at a reasonable revel for my audience? 
   Are there any on-line publicly-available manuals, lecture notes,
   instructional documents that may be useful?

2. I do most of my work in R using Emacs and ESS. That means that I
   keep a file in an emacs window and I submit it to R one line at a
   time or one region at a time, making corrections and iterating as
   needed. When I am done, I just save the file with the last,
   working, correct (hopefully!) version of my code. Is there a way of
   doing something like that, or in the same spirit, without using
   Emacs/ESS? What approach would you use to polish and save your code
   in this case? For my course I will be working in a Windows
   environment. 
   
   While I am looking for simple and effective solutions that do not
   require installing emacs in our computer lab, the answer ""you
   should teach your students emacs/ess on top of R"" is perfecly
   acceptable.
   

Thank you for your consideration, and thank you in advance for the
useful replies.

Have a good day,
Giovanni

A little off the wall, but would it simplify the sealing if you could pressurize

A miniature CO2 cartridge with a release valve may help.

Filling your tracker with already-rejected proposals isn't likely to 
encourage me to look at it, especially when I've personally rejected 
them to you in IRC.  That goes for your ticket #4 as well.

Hi Jim, yes there are files available. Is this for Arthur Andersen ? (I could not tell from Heather's e-mail address)  We have a task force looking into this on behalf of Enron and there is a data room that would have the old Partnership Agreement. This data is under a confidentiality agreement, so I would say contact Drew Fossum about it.  If that is a problem, I have a copy of the old ANNGTC Partnership Agreement (pertaining to the Alaskan segment of ANGTS) that I extracted from InterNorth's old files last summer.  Let me know. Bob Hill. 402-398=7888.

Please let me know your understanding of the deal conditions surrounding the 
""c""list. My current estimate is we may just get the required 84 names from the 
 original list, however, it seems many people from my side have the 
understanding tha t:
     
*       Where someone on the c list said no, we could substitute names. If this 
is the case we have passed the threshold easily.
*       That while my piece of paper says 80% the intent was 70%. Again we 
wouldbe done today.
*       Some of the names are ""mistakes"" which were never intended to be on 
list(this probably accounts for 4 names at least).
     
Obviously, I am keen to report to all that we have achieved the appropriate 
signup percentages and that this deal condition is done.

Subject:	Path Manager Rewrite / Optimization project
Importance:	High

All:

We're currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed.  Going foward, I would like Bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers/schedulers.  We had this approach with Nomlogic and having Clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely.  Who ever you choose, we would need about 15% of their time for now.  Later on, with coordination efforts and testing, it may go up to 75%.  I don't see that happening for a while though.

The sooner we get someone to devote to this, the better off we will be.  I expect these changes that we'll be looking into should improve performance quite a bit.  

That being said, we've identified three items that would speed up processing the retrieval of Path Manager.  

1)  Currently, the Path Manager attempts to reuse Path Ids.  I can't think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step?    It runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn't find a match.  I know Patti has mentioned this several times and I can't think of a valid reason for performing this work.  I talked with Dave Nommensen, and according to him, what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place???  From a scheduling perspective, my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it.  If you were overpathed, you'd see it in the Path Manager either way. [Pinion, Richard]    To restate the question for clarity, in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply, market and a service, adds any up/downstream contract information and/or Duns or DRN override and then saves it.  Unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re-uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id.  I had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted.  Has this changed???  At one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations.  Texas Eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used.  I spoke with Chris Ordway and the new LINK system no longer needs this to occur.  Transco uses activity numbers but uses the Activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected.  Therefore, if it does not create a space or memory problem for Unify, I don't think that this constant old path look up is needed.   [Kinsey, Lisa]   Get rid of this.  

2)  The scheduling position window:  does anyone use this?  If not, we'll remove the code logic that populates this window.  I have never seen a scheduler use this.  Please verify. [Pinion, Richard]   Originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system ""Autonoms"" so it was duplicated in Unify by request.  It is not used in Unify now because of the other sophisticated tools Unify provides which obviate it's use.  The only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems.  As voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - Lose it!  [Kinsey, Lisa]  Why is this still here?	 

3)  On the inventory pool list, does anyone need to see the Contarct References List?  Again, this code is called every retrieval time and doesn't appear to be used from my observations.   If they do need this information, we could provide it, but if not, I'd prefer to remove the functionality. [Pinion, Richard]    This function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool.  Keep it!  [Kinsey, Lisa]  Yes.  We use this functionality a lot when pathing pools.	 

4)  When pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths, what's the average number of paths they create at one time?  What about updates?  I know that ANR and NIGAS are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to.  Does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records?  My real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both Updates and Inserts.  By update, I mean, going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a PSNA which in turn forces a new path to be created. [Pinion, Richard]    This one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline.  There is no 'average'.  They typically update a path with up/downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however.  I hope this answers your question.  I see no change to this process at this time  [Kinsey, Lisa]  On some pipes this function is used more than others.  When it is used we try and do as many paths as possible.  At this time I do not see a need to change this process. 	 

5)  On brokered paths, do you want to utilize the same logic we have for Service?  In other words, when updating Brokered arrangements, we don't incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated?  Why do we do this for service?  Is it because we have to renominate it?  I assume that's what it's for since we don't send brokered paths to the pipe.  Anyway, with the Nomlogic implmentation (two way interface), we were planning on having it behave the same way as service.  We need this verified. [Pinion, Richard]    We don't perform the same logic for Brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path.  I don't see a need to change the way Brokered paths are behaving at this time. [Kinsey, Lisa]  Agree with Richard.

"Brad,

I talked with Keith friday afternoon about the TCO map.  After 1:00pm friday, their server went down, and they couldn't access any of the files or save the changes to the Map.  He told me that if all goes well Monday morning, we can see a map a little after noon.  I will work with him Monday morning to make sure I can have it for you asap.  Right now the map includes current day and yesterday's information for the relevant market delivery zones.  During next week, I will add interconnects to the map as well a storage fields to present a complete picture.

Thanks,

Adam

"Hey Mike It will be handled however the EPA handles the allowance, emissions and the ownership data.  If the EPA shows each company as two separate entities then the SO2 program will do the same.  If we write code to handle this on our own, luck would have it that the EPA will start reporting the two companies together.  It would probably be best for you to give them a call and inquire about how they normally handle this situation.

For a hard-to-find, not-yet-reproducible bug reported by
several users, maybe log their http traffic for a while
and ask them to tell you right away when it happens again,
and then you could see if there were any clues in the
http transactions around that time (something wrong,
something extra present, or something missing).

Of course there might not be any clues there if it's
a database glitch. For that you need a stable of
continuous unit tests running against each server.

Wouldn't hurt to have automated continuous unit tests
testing through the web interface, too.

You probably already know/have these things, but I just
thought I'd share anyway. :)

Do you guys do any high-level abstract visualization
of the servers and the flow of data? heatmaps, geiger-
counter ticks per connection, graphs, turning the
soundex() of each tag into a musical note, that sort
of thing? I think that would be fun.

"Kevin,

Here's some info on Gila Bend - - - please use with discretion.

Sensitivity:	Confidential

Eric:

I spoke earlier today with the banker who led the TECO-Panda financing for Societe Generale (lead arranger with Citi on the $2.2 bill. merchant project financing).  Following is a summary of the call with healthy amount of detail since it may be some time before we have a chance to visit.  Due to confidentialities, Jim could only go so far on some details, so you'll note a number of gaps; however, this should cover many of your questions.  Call upon return after the holiday and we can discuss further.

Also attached - after notes - is an article that should capture many of the financing details.  Given other demands, I've not yet read the article so duplication between the notes and article is inevitable.  A word of caution - PFI details are good but not always accurate so rely principally on the call notes.  I also asked for portions of the Offering Memo. but am doubtful on receiving this.  Distribute further as you see fit.

Summary of Call
This was a merchant financing with both projects (Phoenix and El Dorado, Arkansas) cross-collateralized and x-defaulted - so treated as a single financing.  
Approx. 2250 MW per site for total of 4500 MW (with 4 separate units per site).
Sources of funding - Total of $2.8 Bill. ($2.2 Bill in debt and $600 MM in funded equity).  Apparently all of the $600 MM equity was funded at close June 01' [further confirmation is needed].  Of the $2.2 Bill. in debt, $1.7 Bill. was non-recourse and $500 MM was an equity bridge, with recourse to partners.  However, lenders looked principally to TECO's credit backed by several guaranty of equity bridge and fronting of the $600 MM in funded equity.
Partnership - 50/50 in all respects (ie. vote and economics).  However, TECO must have some preferential rights (eg. cash flows etc..) given their substantial commits on the deal.  
Term of debt - 2 yrs. construct facility plus 3 yr. mini-perm with bullet at maturity (approx. 8% amortized at maturity).  Five years is the market for merchant deals.  Amortization is 18 yr. mortgage style.  144 A expected form of permanent take-out of term debt.  
Leverage - 60% financed by term debt, but approx. 50% debt financed when adding all ancillary facilities and other commits (ie. working capital, letters of credit etc..).  Jim kept details to minimum but further info. is needed here.
Key Ratio was debt service coverage.  Base Case assumed an average DSCR of 3.40X and Min. of 2.40X with cash trapped at 1.75X.  Did not get detail on whether DSCR was both historical and forward looking, but suspect there was some kind of forward test.  Project finance banks typically expect 3.25 to 4.25 DSCR on merchant finance deals.
Leverage, DSCR and structure in general was done based on what is generally required to gain investment grade rating from agencies when permanent take-out is sought.  Additional rating agency requirements can be found on Moody's and S&P web sites.  
TECO also will act as operator.  TECO was clearly crucial to deal and at least Soc. Gen. had done prior deals with them (not sure about Citi).  Panda brought TECO into the deals.  Although Panda was a known quantity, Soc. Gen. had no direct project history with them.
Fuel and Power Off take - Lenders looked to extensive an Energy Management Program analysis.  The EMP presumed (by C.O.D.):  50% of fuel and power would be under firm contract, 25% of each would be covered by seasonal swing contracts and remaining 25% would remain merchant.  Intention is a complete match (term and volumes) for fuel and power contracts.  Agency agreements were signed with Noble (1yr. contract) on fuel supply mgt. and Aquilla (2 yr. contract) for managing power sales.  Each buys in name of the projects.  TECO is responsible for overall energy mgt. and coordination between Noble and Aquilla.  Jim said EOD is triggered if fuel and power agreements are not signed in line with E.M. Program by C.O.D.  Lenders got comfortable with lack of fuel and power contracts due to substantial equity commitment (approx. $1.1 Bill.).
Consultants were Pace for fuel supply and overall energy management and RW Beck for power market eval.
Fuel Transport - Much of medium term contracted at close (mix of firm and interruptible capacity) out to 7 yrs.  Lenders looked to new and released capacity to fill non-contracted needs.

Will continue to dig.  Thanks for the greater detail on the questions.  I don't expect much but will let you know if anything notable comes of the call.

Thanks for the quick response.  The objective at ETS is to arrange a long term gas transportation agreement with the Gila Bend project.  We estimate their requirements to be 386,000 MMBtus/day and understand that El Paso has agreed to provide 100,000 MMBtus/day.  Gila Bend is one of several potential strategic shippers for our project and we are extremely interested in the credit quality of their project, recourse to parents, etc.

Principle risks + mitigants to understand:
Gas supply arrangements
Gas transportation arrangements
Financing arrangements, sources of funds
Power off-take arrangements
Who is the Operator?
Ownership structure, decision-making, etc.
Financial recourse to parents

I spoke with the project bankers at one of the lead banks (principal underwriters) here in town.  They are scheduling a call for me with the banker who lead the deal on their side.  I will be asking about fuel supply issues, key risks, terms etc.  Forward any additional questions you have and/or provide more specific questions of fuel etc.. and I'll give it a go.  I also asked for the Offering Memo., which will be near impossible to get due to confidentiality issues but will let you know how it goes.  Let's visit about you attending as well.

In the Handyboard homepage under 6500 polaroid sonar libraries, there is a
great illustration (BRAVO!) that depicts the connections from the HB to
the module that operates the sonar itself.  The power supply to the module
(which should be around +5V) is connected via the motor power supply
hookup with 6 diodes in series to reduce the 9V to the required range.

My question is: can I use any +5V / ground connection on the HB
instead of the motor power supply  (Our supply is an external one and
uses almost 30V and rather than connecting 30-some diodes in series... you
get the point) ???

Also, Can I use D2 and D3 to control a second sonar module without too
many changes?

Thank you,

Yoni Garbourg

"good summary - we will make sure our risk guys understand what they need to do when setting up a new commodity

Subject:	Post Mortem on ERMS books not getting into RisktRAC

Problem:  
14 ERMS EGM books were not picked up in RisktRAC due to a mismatch of attributes between ERMS and RisktRAC.  

Root Cause: The over riding issue is that the current processes to keep RisktRAC up to date are so manual that the probability of errors such as this occuring are very high (point in fact - I had 1.5 people doing this last year and now have 4 + 2 managers to support + 1 director to support them).  Specifically, what occured in this case is:

Attribute mismatches happen frequently when there is more than one commodity per in the source system book.  When setting up new books, the book admin must indicate that there is more than one commodity in the book (or that the commodity identifier ie BRN has changed to BRNT) so Risk Analytics can set up the appropriate number of books (there is not a one to one ratio between ERMS books and RistRAC books).  In this case, these books were already being used for BRNT trades.  At the end of Aug/ early Sept these books also started being used for BRN and BRCM positions as well.  The additional usage for these books was not communicated to Risk Analytics therefore no additional books were set up in RisktRAC.  Additionally, there was no effective compensating control for Risk Analytics to catch this problem.

Procedures to ensure this doesn't happen again:
Short term
1) Training - training sessions for book admins to remind them of RisktRAC requirements- pilot class has been taught and first ""real"" class is Wednesday of this week.
2) Compensating control to be put in place - Risk Analytics is creating a role to review all exception reporting available on a daily basis (whether a book came from the source system but was not picked up by RisktRAC, whether a book was picked up but not included for VAR purposes etc).

Medium term
Greenlight - revamping benchmarks to pull from RMS (table where data is kept for RisktRAC) so the positions per ERMS can be easily reconciled to RisktRAC, other projects within RisktRAC being identified.

Long term
Strategic vision of RisktRAC (front end & all exception reporting needed) - user requirements being developed.

Wanda's QU's not answered above:
1) How long have these books not been in RisktRAC - Our best guess is end-August, early Sept when the books started to be used for several commodity types.
2) What is the impact on VAR?  -  The preliminary VAR for Thursday's trading was $12.928 million.  This export did not have the 14 books in it.  The final VAR for Thursday morning was $12.892 million. The final had about 10 of the 14 books - the other four hadn't yet been set up.  .2% - clearly immaterial
3) What was the volume missing?  300K barrels (per EGM).  - total positions were 5.3 mil BBL for Thursday's trading - approximatly 6% - a bit more material.

What's the story on this one?  Who can best answer the four questions posed by Wanda?  How soon can we have answers?  Interestingly, I have a 4:00 PM meeting today with Rick Buy, David Port, Wanda Curry, Bill Bradford and Debbie Brackett (rescheduled from last Friday re: Project Greenlight, due to Buy's schedule).  I would like to be more informed than they are at 4:00.  Thanks.  --Sally

Sally,

FYI.  This is an example of the issues associated with the risk feeds and the need to document the universe of books that should be sent to RisktRAC on a daily basis.  Both Todd and Shona are working to reconcile RisktRAC positions to the source liquids books, identify the omitted books and make corrections.  The total volume difference is 3.4 million barrels (not certain this is accurate, but material under any circumstance).  I am also not certain how long these positions have not been included.  I believe this issue it limited to VAR only, and that CreditAg has been reporting the credit exposures. 

It would be a good idea to dissect this particular problem to understand the scope of what we need for Project Green Light.  If you would like to discuss this further, let me know.  I would like to ask for the following,  1) how long have these books not been included in RisktRAC,   2) what is the impact on V@R,   3) total volumes not reported,  and 4) reason for omission (I believe it had to do with the portfolio hierarchy).  Please, let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Wanda

"" there may be two separate questions to ask here . first , in the context of the current market ( or the market which may develop in the next 1 - 2 years ) , will the metarouter be a commercially viable product ? that is , will it address an actual need in the market , or would it be more cost effective just to use technicians with jumper cables to provision circuits ? the second question ( our first real technical question ) : is the metarouter technology scalable ? before starting on this project , vince and i will need to make the proper introductions with the principles who are implementing this technology . 3 . aggregation of loads . a recurring question comes from a number of areas such as ip , network storage , and streaming media transport sales : what value can i get form aggregating customers , each of which has some type of stochastic load profile ? giuseppe touched on this problem as it relates to ip transport , but it may be interesting to try and look in more detail . the main stumbling block may be that we currently have basically no actual customer data . i am told that in a few months we will have some more useful history . my understanding is that what will be available will be 5 - minute averages of usage , so we still will not know on a short time scale what the distribution of load looks like . i hope that this gives you enough information to get some idea of what our concerns are at this point . please let me know your thoughts about these topics . i would expect , for instance that question number 1 may not be reasonable as a research project , but might be a question which you would feel comfortable in addressing by giving us your qualitative opinions , maybe in the form of a talk here at enron . again , let me know your thoughts , and i look forward to seeing you again soon . stinson nick bambos on 12 / 20 / 2000 12 : 14 : 40 pm to : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com cc : stinson . gibner @ enron . com subject : stanford project hello vince and stinson , first of all , best wishes for happy holidays ! ! ! ! if you are in the stanford area during the holidays , let ' s get together some time to have dinner . i have formally established the project - thanks again for funding it - and i have also recruited the second phd student . his name is eric cope , and he is a top - notch student , very mature , and entrepreneurial ! we have started working on some interesting problems in this area . i would hope that eric could spend the coming summer at enron to get immersed into the "" problem / opportunity generation environment . "" that really helps the student to develop a realistic vision about their research . perhaps , our whole team could visit enron again some time in the next quarter , say in march or so , to discuss the research issues we are pursuing . and of course you could visit us before that too . with my warmest wishes , nick",clean

My French is a bit iffy these days, but if this is true, does it not also
nullify Microsoft, Adobe and WinZip licences amongst most others? These all
claim no liability, no guarantees (M$ say delivered ""with all faults"", so
at least they are honest).

We plan to send it tomorrow afternoon after we receive your comments. Paul E. Stein, Deputy Attorney General State of California Office of the Attorney General 455 Golden Gate Avenue, Suite 11000 San Francisco, CA  94102 Dear Mr. Stein: This responds to your letter of July 13, 2001, which I received on July 16, regarding your discussions with Mike Kirby and me on behalf of Enron Energy Services (EES).  This will confirm that you agreed that our discussions with the Office of the Attorney General on the subject of its subpoenas served upon EES are without prejudice to, and will not waive, any rights by EES to object to either this investigation or the subpoenas in any subsequent action or proceeding.  Your letter of July 13, 2001, notes some, but by no means all, of EES's objections to the subpoenas.  Without attempting to catalogue these objections, the following points in your July 13 letter merit mention: *	Confidentiality order:  This confirms we will provide you with a suitable alternative confidentiality order for your review this week. *	Customer notification:  EES has been, and continues to be in the process of, providing appropriate notice to all commercial customers (without regard for any other definition) in California with regard to your request for their contracts.  We do not agree that our duty, if any, to resist production under the terms of these contracts has been discharged. *	Territoriality:  Our objections to your requests for out of state documents and the testimony by out of state residents arises under California statutes, common law, and California and the Constitution of the United States. *	Document repository:  We do not believe the Attorney General is entitled to production of any documents other than at a central location. *	Production:  Without waiving any of our objections to either the Attorney General's investigation or the subpoena, EES is prepared to produce documents which reside within California which are unambiguously called for by the subpoena served on June 27, 2001, on the condition that we reach a mutually acceptable confidentiality order to govern their production. Assuming a mutually agreeable protective order, we are ready to begin doing so on or about July 30. Thank you for your courtesies in these matters. Sincerely, Michael E.

Both had the header line Return-Path:  when they arrived to me. My impression is however that most junk sent via tex-fonts are viruses rather than spam. It would probably be a good idea to add some filtering to the tex-fonts list, so that most ""bad"" messages would bounce back to the sender rather than be delivered to all the recipients. Such a filter could also help enforcing the list rules about ""no large attachments"" and ""no HTML"". Perhaps this is something for the administrator(s) to consider? I think most of the needed functionality---the notable exception is the part about attachments---comes out of the box with SpamBouncer (http://www.spambouncer.org/). This program is essentially a collection of procmail recepies, which means adding tests is probably not very hard. In my experience it catches most spam (at least most of the spam I get), although the two items mentioned above passed all its filters. That could however be due to that our postmaster hasn't updated the program for a while now. Lars Hellström",clean

Your model only includes an intercept, so the fitted value  is supposed to be 
the same for all units (there is nothing in your model that allows the fitted 
value to vary across units).

"Romantic hideaways need not be lacy and frilly. A perfect example is the Ice House. This is possibly the most unusual, yet delightfully romantic hotel in the world.

What's so special about it? It's made entirely from ice! The floor? Made of ice. The ceiling? Ice. But the bed? You got it - ice! Top to bottom, total ice.	

The Ice House, which has several rooms, is comfortably warm, though I wouldn't recommend going barefoot. Guest accommodations are nice and cozy, with oversized, plush comforters keeping visitors toasty throughout the night. Dozens of candles are the only source of light. They're everywhere - small ones peak out of icy nooks and tall ones stand at attention on the floor. They reflect off the surrounding ice, creating a surreal effect. And even though the light comes from open flame, no, the ceiling doesn't drip on you.

Though a weekend of winter whimsy may be romantic to some, others' idea of a romantic getaway involves warm ocean breezes. In Bali, it's not rare for private villas to be completely open to the soothing winds. Guests drift to sleep with a majestic starlit sky for a ceiling and the soothing sound of waves breaking against the beach to lull them into dreamland. If the warm breezes and sounds of the ocean are still not romantic enough, guests can order all their meals in - or, in this case, is it out?

Regardless of which dream hideaway you prefer, a sanctuary that provides total tranquillity and allows us to forget our ""real"" lives is the perfect romantic setting.

Though you can spend a lot of time and money creating your own romantic hideaway, there really is no set price tag for creating a personal retreat. It can cost next to nothing, and you can create it in your own home.

What's your most romantic room - typically the bedroom. Not romantic enough? Critique it. What's right? What's wrong? The room definitely needs some thought and a theme. Without a theme, we tend to wander, lose focus, and end up with a hodge-podge.

Then think back to all the romantic locations you've ever visited or wanted to visit. What was it that lingered in your mind and tugged at your heart? Then ponder, ""is there anything like that I can bring into my life?"" 

To start, begin with a favorite fabric and an exquisite bed or chair and expand from there, ingredient by ingredient. Don't be afraid to bring in fantasy. Yes, fantasy can be in good taste, classic but with a sense of romance. Done correctly, no one will know exactly what your theme or inspirations were. Stay subtle, don't let the room or any part of it scream at you. This way you'll find that you will probably enjoy it for years to come...

Remember, above all, have fun!


Tips By Julee!!!

Tip #1. Bored with winter? Invite a friend over (how about your spouse?) for a traditional afternoon tea. Prepare English tea sandwiches made from watercress, egg salad and cucumber and serve freshly-baked scones topped with Devonshire cream and preserves. Serve with black tea (capful of vanilla) or Jasmine tea. Entertaining a friend with children? Serve young ones hot chocolate, scones and sandwiches of Nutella and bananas (yum!) or ham and cheese. 

Tip #2. Sunny windows destroy fabric and fade paint. Remedy? Keep the view while protecting your furnishings from harmful UV rays. Have glass ""film"" applied to your windows. There are several choices for degrees of darkness and color. Survey says? People are raving about it!

Tip #3. A room with no windows? Create an illusion with a pair of French doors. Attach them to the wall with gathered fabric hanging behind. Build window seats on either side with a wall-to-wall mirror above each seat. Then paint the walls a light and glossy color to give the room a light and airy feel.


Questions to Julee

Could you tell me the formula used for lamp lighting? How high should the lamp be on a table beside a sofa? On a bedside table? Which is better for reading, a floor lamp with the illumination coming from the top (like a torchiere) or from below (with a traditional shade)?

It is unwise to apply a diehard rule or formula, because the styles of the lamp, the table and the sofa or chairs all contribute to the total picture. Plus, there is more than just function involved. Common sense tells us to be sure the reading light (as opposed to general or accent lighting) is intense and focused on your reading material not on your face. Try out a few lamps until you find one that works.

Ideally, a three-way light is most functional. One turn of the switch shoots (general) light to the ceiling, another turn directs light down and a third, even brighter, allows for tasks. These are often torchieres.


I love the natural looking tortoiseshell (or matchstick) blinds I've been seeing. However, my drapes are floral and are hung from a pewter rod. Are they a good match or are the blinds too rustic for my existing décor?

Yes, it is possible to combine tortoiseshell blinds with fabric. Two successful examples would include (a) a patterned fabric in a larger scale than the tortoise, but in the same tone (not darker or lighter colors), or (b) a solid fabric (no obvious pattern) but very textured (nubby) with any color from a natural pallet.


I have adjacent rooms and would like to paint one red and the other blue. Would this interrupt the flow? What do you recommend for accessories and window coverings so these spaces, which open to one another, work well?

First, be certain that your blue and red paints are from the same ""season."" For example don't use a winter red with a spring blue. Next pick a neutral color that goes well in both rooms. Add a little red into the blue room and blue into the red room and use the neutral color in both. When adding the neutral and the opposing colors to the main color, remember to keep their use minimal. Their purpose is as accent colors and they should be used only in trims, borders, frames, linens, or accessories. The red room should remain primarily a red room.

You can't imagine how I detested being mocked at school. 

I hated the weight and I detested myself. 

After trying many different remedies I learned about Anatrim. 

This stuff literally dragged me out of this dreadful nightmare! The warmest thanks to you, fellows.""

 
Mikkey Fox, San Diego

 
""You know what? Thanks to Anatrim my marriage was saved! I went into this circle, depression � eating more � just more depression. My wife had thought to leave me as I was turning in overweight psycho. 

My friend pointed at your web site and I ordered up my pack of Anatrim right away. 

The results were great, my appetite became normal, I was in a good mood oftener, and, be sure, I became able to tighten my belt on some holes. And you see, the bed became cool also!""

FROM THE DESK OF
BARRISTER JONES ANDERSON
SOLICITORS & ADVOCATES
LONDON,U.K.

Dear Friend,

I write you in good faith, hoping that you will treat this letter as a 
desperate search for assistance in a matter that shall benefit both of us. A random search based on your locality from the Internet produced your name and address and that of two others in your country. 

I am JONES ANDERSON an Attorney to a deceased Immigrant property magnate who was based in the U.K., also referred to as my client.On the 25th of July 2000, my client, his wife and their two Children died in the Air France concord plane crash bound for New York in their plan for a world cruise,  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm 

Since then I have been managing his properties here in the U.K. and some others which he put out for sale. The properties which have long been put out on sale have now been paid for and now the money paid has long been deposited into his local bank account here. I have contacted you to assist in repatriating themoney and estate left behind by my client before they get confisticated or declared unserviceable by his 
bank.

Particularly, the bank has issued me with a notice to provide any of his next of kin or have the account confisticated within a short period of time. my late  client has an account valued at 6.5 Million United States Dollars Only. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating any of my clients relatives for some time now and with no one coming forward since my clients passing on, and with the bank now giving me a deadline, I now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my deceased 
client, so that the proceeds of his account valued at 6.5 Million 
United States Dollars Only can be paid to you. This I intend we share amongst ourselves in the ratio of 50% to me and 40% for you while the balance 10% we shall use for settling any miscellaneous expenses that might arise.

I have all the necessary information that can be used to back up any Claim that we may make and I can assure you that you shall be paid this amount as the next of kin to my late client.

All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under alegitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Trust me as his attorney that this is a risk-free relationship. Please get in touch with me via email and send me your full names and address, telephone and fax numbers to enable us discuss further about this 
transaction.

Best regards,

JONES ANDERSON

"So far (eep!), the documentation talks about file test operators as
working with pairs, which will be a weird thing to explain, I guess.
I'm wondering if this matters to the mere user at all, and if we should
even talk about them in terms of ""pairs"". I don't want a different set
of terms in the docs and Llama6. Even if the current Pugs is different
than what the final answer will be, as long as I know the final answer
I'll be fine. :)

For a directory that exists, using the adverbial form or the fat arrow
form work for true or false things:


   pugs> 'doc' ~~ :d
   ""doc""
   pugs> ""doc"" ~~ d => 1
   ""doc""
   pugs> ""doc"" ~~ d => 0
   Bool::False


The fat arrow doesn't seem to work as I expected with :s though. I
figured that the value of the pair would be the thing to match the 
answer of the test. I expect these all to be expressions of the same
goal (even if they return different things right now):


   pugs> ""doc"" ~~ :s  # just to show you where I am
   136

   pugs> ( ""doc"" ~~ :s ) == 136
   Bool::True
   pugs> ( ""doc"" ~~ :s ) ~~ 136
   Bool::True
   pugs> ""doc"" ~~ s => 136   # perhaps accidentally fine
   136


So, if I wanted to see if the file had a size of 93 bytes, I'd use 93
as the value of the pair, but that doesn't work. It just returns true
again:


   pugs> ""doc"" ~~ s => 93  # I want this to fail (return Bool:I:False)
   136


Similarly, if that last form should work, I might want to do something
similar with the file age tests. I want a file 5 days old (let's ignore
fractional days right now):


   ""doc"" ~~ M => 5;


Which then makes me think I'd want to do something a bit wacky to see
if the modtime is greater than 5:


   ""doc"" ~~ M => any( 5 ..* );


But, if file tests aren't really meant to be like this and the user
shouldn't ever think like this, do I call it a ""pair""? That's the
question I'll have to answer to the newbie reading LLama6, even though
I personally am fine with the term. :)

A few more details ................   Again, most of the EGA companies' ownership trail includes all Enron ownership through a number of Enron entities.  Through further research, we found a few more that don't totally fit that mold:
 
Elektro - Electricidad e Servicos S.A. in Brazil  .... 38% of this company if publicly held with the remainder held by Enron entities.
EPE - Empresa Productora de Energia Ltda in Brazil has outside owners including Shell and LJM Brazilco and Interjuris S/C Ltda. a.k.a. Shell Cuiaba Holdings owns two shares and has a 1% direct ownership interest and one Board vote.
Energia Ltd, another Brazil operation, is owned by ENBRAS which in turn in owned by Enron Corp.   (Shares of the company are pledged to Westdeusche Landesbank Gironzentrale as of 22 Feb. 01.
 
Again, this may be more information than you ever wanted or needed but thought you might like to know.

Steve:
 
As stated earlier, many of the company names on the list that was provided either do not exactly match what we have in corporate records or there is such a long list with very similar names that we have just made assumptions in most cases regarding ownership.
 
We can assure you that, for the most part, you have placed the companies in the correct business bucket (i.e., Corp., ENA, EES, etc.).  There are a few, however, that may be incorrectly categorized, as follows:
 
EA:             ECT Non U.S. Payroll Company (there is no such entity, but I would assume these folks are paid by ENA)
                   Enron Capital & Trade Resources in London, UK  (may actually be Enron Europe company called Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited)
 
EBS:           Broadband Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (actually comes up to Corp. through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance)
 
EEOS:        Enron Engineering & Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp.
                   The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd. whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe.  
 
EES:           Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity
                    The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities Services/Limbach companies
 
EGA:         Here's where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with 
                 complicated, multi-layers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp. ownership.  As you know all of the old subsets (i.e. APACHI, CALME, etc.) have
                 gone away and everything international is now EGA.    To the best of our knowledge, all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed.
                 Following are the exceptions and/or unusual organizational structure that should be noted:
                    Electricidad Enron de Guatemala S.A. actually reports up through ENA
                    San Juan Gas Company, Inc. in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp. (100% owned)
                    Enron American del Sur, S.A.  is an Enron Corp./Enron Transportation Services entity
                    No entity called Enron Singapore .... more than likely Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company.
 
EIM:         No Stadacona Paper Company but it  is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM 
                Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp. as the general partner and a list of Limited
                Partners including ENA, Enron Corp. and a non-Enron entity (Salomon Brothers Holding Company, Inc.)
 
ENW:        Enron Net Works, LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp. company
 
EWC:        The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp. which is owned by Smith Street Land Co., an Enron Corp. company, but many of the 
                 names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list.   For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas, S.A.; 
                 no Enron Wind UK, no Enron Wind India .... but regardless, they are all part of the EWC/EREC family.
 
GLOBAL    These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration & Production, Inc., which is owned by Enron Corp., but one has indirect outside ownership.
 EP:           Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd., for instance, is owned by Enron Asst Holdings, which is owned by Enron Finance Partners, which is part of a complex ownership
                 structure that includes one non-Enron entity (Zephyrus Investments, LLC) with a small interest.      
                    
Again, I hope this information is helpful.  For the most part the list appears to be in order except for the ones mentioned and for the fact that so many of the names are incomplete and hard to definitively track.  Let my group know if we can be of additional assistance.

"Hello Twitter-ers,

It's time for a semi-monthly update from Twitter headquarters in 
sunny San Francisco, CA. There's lots of attention and activity 
surrounding Twitter these days and we're focused on staying ahead 
of pace. Don't miss a beat, come by and visit http://twitter.com 
to see what we're up to.

Bucking The System

Last weekend CNN lead with a big story about James Buck, a 
graduate student in journalism from the University of 
California-Berkeley who was arrested last month in Mahalla, Egypt 
while covering an anti-government protest. Thinking quickly, James 
was able to send a one-word Twitter update: ""Arrested."" His 
followers in Egypt and back in the US reacted by contacting the 
university and the consulate on his behalf. Before long, James was 
updating Twitter with another one-word message, ""Free.""

Twitter Japan

While we're on the subject of international adventures, it should 
be noted that Twitter has officially launched in Japan. We noticed 
a significant percent of Twitter usage consistently originating 
from Japan despite the fact that our service is in English. This 
highlighted an opportunity for us to make Twitter better so we 
worked with our partner in Japan, Digital Garage to launch a 
Japanese version of Twitter.

baby's birth so we know there are some new moms on Twitter. Are 
you a mom on Twitter? Is your own mom on Twitter? Maybe you even 
made ""The Ultimate List of Moms on Twitter""? Mother's Day is just 
around the corner so don't forget to @reply the moms you know with

Chris,

I was surprised to get your message when I got into the office this morning. I tried to call you back several times this morning but your phone never went to phone mail. In short, we stopped our attempts to get the information Alliant had requested. I thought Frank was going to let you know.

Alliant's request was discussed after one of the weekend conference calls a couple weeks ago. Frank Semin,  Lynn Blair, and I  ( I think Steve January and Terry Kowalke stayed after also) discussed the matter because the IT Group wasn't having any success retrieving the data and indicated that any data that could be retrieved would not readily show if injections or withdrawals were allocated. Each individual allocation would have to be reviewed to determine which activity, injections or withdrawals, was allocated. The retrieval effort would have tied up our limited IT and Gas Logistics resources with little, if any results.  Based on that, the decision was made to stop the effort. 

I thought Frank was going to let you know about our discussion and the decision that was reached. I apologize for not following up with you personally on the matter.

Are you talking about the location of /boot? You can set this up at

That might be the problem: 'powerpc64' not 'ppc64'.  What Linux distro is

PLEASE MAIL BACK

My Dearest ONE
May the peace of gracious God be with you,please I have a problem which I 
needed a help from you,I have decided to write you for help.

I have a proposal for you-this however is not mandatory nor will I in any 
manner compel you to honour against your will.

I am in a state of delinma and made up my mind to send you this mail , I am 
ROSLINE MATHEW ,21 years old and the only daughter of my late parents Mr. 
and Mrs. MATHEW NZOBEl.

My father was a highly reputable business magnet (a cocoa merchant) who 
operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days.

It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of 
his bus iness trips abroad on 12th.Febuary 2004.

Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been 
masterminded by an
uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.

But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and 
since then my father took me so special.

Before his death on February 12 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied 
him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of eight million, seven 
hundred thousand United State Dollars.(USD$8.700,000) left in one of the 
leading security company.

He further told him that he depaosited the money in my name, and finally 
issued a written instruction to his lawyer whom he said is in possession of 
all the necessary legal documents to this fund and the security company .

I am just 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know 
what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result o 
f incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father 
actually brought sorrow to my life. I am in a sincere desire of your humble 
assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly 
regarded.

Now permit me to ask these few questions:-

1. Can you honestly help me as your daughter?

2. Can I completely trust you?

3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you 
after the money is in your account?

Please, Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.

Thank you so much.Mey God bless you and your family.

My sincere regards,

ROSLIN MATHEW

"Hello,
 
I'm a relatively new user of DMDX. To date I've used it in only 1
experiment - a recognition task. 
Currently, I'm setting up another recognition study, but this time a
concurrent task has been added. It is unclear to me how to specify the
timing for the concurrent task in the item file. 
 
Some details of the study...
Stimuli (words) will be presented for 2 seconds each, while high and low
tones (the concurrent task) will alternate every 1.5 seconds. The
subject's task will be (1) to judge whether each presented word is ""old""
or ""new"" and (2) to simultaneously perform the auditory discrimination
task. The 1.5 sec auditory patterns will be presented CONTINUOSULY as
participants make recognition decisions. The participants' task will be
to listen to these patterns and to press a button with their left index
finger every time a sound pattern changes from A to B or B to A.
 
For example, the item file will begin with a word (e.g. ""PUMPKIN"") which
will stay on the screen for 2s.
""Tone A"" (playing for 1.5 seconds) will simultaneously begin playing
when ""PUMPKIN"" appears.
""Tone B"" will begin following the termination of ""Tone B""; the next word
(e.g. ""RYHTHM"")
will appear after the 2s presentation of ""PUMPKIN"" is finished and so
on..
Responses and RTs need to be collected for every response.
 
Any insight into how to specify the timing for the concurrent task in
the item file would be greatly appreciated.
 
Thank you,
Kelly

  $hash{undef()}

You need to use the () because otherwise Perl would automatically 
quote the undef. So $hash{undef} is equivalent to $hash{'undef'}.

You might also do something like this:

  my $NULL;
  print $hash{$NULL};

Can't be, I just did a simple copy-and-paste and ran the script. It worked.

In line 19 and line 24 you have a quotation mark at the beginning of a 
command, but no closing quotation mark.
By the way, when I pasted the script I had only 23 lines, how did you get 24 
lines? The first line is the shebang (#!/bin/sh). Please post the content of 
your script (including empty lines).

Hi all.

Say I want to get 2 files via ftp, but I want to do it in a specific
order, and I don't want file2 to start downloading until file1 is
finished downloading. For example, if I were to execute get file1.tar,
and get file2.tar, I want get file2.tar to be executed only after get
file1.tar is done.

I see that lftp has a queue command. Does anyone know if this would
work the way I expect? What I mean is if I execute:

queue get file1.tar
queue get file2.tar

in lftp, would that in fact wait to download file2.tar until the
download of file1.tar was complete?

If the queue command in lftp doesn't work this way, then is there
another command that would do what I want? If lftp can't do what I
want, then can ncftp do that? If so, then how? I have looked through
the ncftp man page as well, and this doesn't seem to be doable in
ncftp. If neither lftp or ncftp can do what I want, then is there
another ftp client for gnu/linux that can?

Just to clarify, I don't want to time-schedule the downloads, I simply
want them to happen sequentially one after another, in a specific
order, (I.E. file2.tar can download right after file1.tar, but it
can't start downloading while file1.tar is still being downloaded).

On another note, does anyone know for sure if put in lftp or ncftp
will retry an upload until it successfully completes, if the upload
keeps being interrupted, say due to network issues? I'm fairly sure the
answer here for both programs is yes, but I wanted to make
certain. Thanks in advance.

Greg

Gail,

Eileen is out of the office today; however, I have confirmed that Rob Cole of Corporate Risk Management is handling this matter directly with the insurance carrier, Travelers.  Risk Management is not, at this time, retaining the Litigation Unit to assist with the claim.  It is my understanding that an acknowledgement letter has been sent in response to the Keiffer letter and Rob Cole is working with NEPCO's safety director, Tony Blair-Softich, to obtain additional necessary information.  

Please let us know if we can be of further assistance.

Eileen,
	I have reviewed the letter and, to the extent that this involves a personal injury/insurance issue, It sounds like it falls  within your area of responsibility.  Please confirm that this is correct and that your group will work with David and the folks at NEPCO to sort out what needs to be done to respond. It may be that the subject coverage is with NEPCO and there won't be much if anything for you to do.
	David, please confirm that you have received the referenced letter, let me know whether you have information about this fellow sufficient to identify the insurance information requested, and also let me know if I can do anything to assist.  
	Thanks.

He didn't say it was impossible to live without backtracking once you have
seen the light, just difficult. I'm not sure what you mean by ""lazy lists""
- I haven't heard that term before, but if I understand what you mean then
isn't using arrays/lists to hold intermediate results then returning to one
of those previous states to continue along another path also backtracking?
That's what I call it, but perhaps I am misusing the term.

This is Planning's response to your request of 10/10/2001 regarding two new gas wells hook up into TW's system.
The two wells were as follows:

SE/4 of Section 20- 23S-27E Eddy County, NM 

This well is located near Sid Richardson gathering system and approximately 4.4 miles to the suction side of the TW- Keystone Compressor Station.
The suction pressure at Keystone is 525-575 psig.
Are they interested to build up to 4.5 miles of pipe to TW? If they are what is pressure/maximum volume that this well can produce?


Center of Section 22-Block B-3 PSL Winkler County Texas

This well is located approximately .3-.5 mile to TW-Crawford 16"" lateral. The Crawford lateral line pressure is 680-720 psig.
Can this well meet TW's line pressure ? what is the maximum flow rate on this well?


Please share this information with your customer and let me know about your response on this project?

I am looking to see if TWPL is close to the two wells that are about to drilled. I work with Lori Vining at Beacon Petroleum and I am trying to find Pipelines in the area.
The areas are:
Eddy County, New Mexico - SE/4 of SECT 20  23S-27E.
Winkler County, Texas - Center of SECT 22 - B3 Public School Land
I went out to the Point catalog and looked up the counties to see what was in the area and found some information, but I was just wanting to make sure I get it right.
I would appreciate any help.

"Jerry,

Some time ago your reported slow network speed when transferring files between your research machine and jlab.
At the time I identified two links out on the Internet that were experiencing some congestion.

I have noticed in the last week or two that our Internet2/Abilene connection had been getting some heavy use. 
I suspected you might be taking advantage of this resource, and sure enough, the traffic is between Physics and
jlab.

So, I am interested in whether you are experiencing better file transfer rates and also how you were able to take 
advantage of Internet2. Did jlab get an I2 connection, or did they allow you to use a different machine on their network
with such a connection.

I'm interested because we have had the I2 connection for some time now, and you are the first faculy member of which I am aware 
who has taken advantage of this resource.

Look forward to your response.

"Hello all,

After reinstalling Gentoo twice and still eventually encountering this
same strange gnome problem, I figured it was time to pass this along to
the knowledgable folks on this list. For reference, I'm on a duel-core
AMD system, using gnome-2.16 with an svn orca version (newer revisions
don't apper to fix this) and espeak-1.25 with the orca espeak driver.

What happens is this. After about 15 minutes or so of leaving gnome/orca
idle (I still work on text consoles a lot), the keyboard in gnome stops
responding. Orca still speaks in gaim, but nothing else works, not even
alt-f2 and typing 'gnome-terminal.' The only way to regain the keyboard
is through /etc/init.d/xdm restart.

One possible reason for this problem might have been the upgrade to
glibc-2.5-r3 from glibc-2.5-r2 (although if a minor package revision
causes this much trouble, that's not good). Is there any way to trace
the entirety of my x session, like a strace-type program that will just
trace all the interwoven X programs that make up a gnome session?
.xsession-errors and /var/log/Xorg.0.log tell me nothing.

If anyone could give me suggestions on how to at least pin down what is
causding this issue, I might be able to file a bug report with the
gentoo folks and see a solution found. If anyone needs (e.g.) my
/etc/make.conf, email me off-list.

Thanks in advance,
Garrett

As you know, the Corporate Responsibility group has commissioned a survey of Enron's stakeholders to gauge their opinions on corporate social responsibility and how they perceive Enron in that regard (along with comparison companies so it will not be obvious that it is Enron that has commissioned the survey.)  Lists of stakeholders to be surveyed have been compiled with the help of various corporate and business unit staff to get to a sample of 100 (50 companies,  25 government/regulators, 10 non-governmental organizations, and 15 from media, finance and academia).

The survey questionnaire is attached below.  It was written for the company respondents, with some adjustments for government, NGO and others in bold pink font.  Kelly suggested that the questionnaire would benefit from your review.  Please provide me your comments, or any questions, by Monday, September 24.

I was thinking you could easily create a spamtrap which you 
subscribe to lots of legitimate nonspam mailing lists, plus you 
also spread the email address around and get it in the hands of 
lots of spammers so it ends up receiving large quantities of 
both spam and nonspam, then you have it apply the algorithm 
above to the incoming mail stream.  So it could be thousands of 
actual real, different, emails per day.  The ""very high rate 
triggers alarms"" thing is certainly something which would be 
possible to check for, but there may be legitimate ways to 
exhibit this behavior -- can't think of one right now but ""AOL 
proxy server"" springs to mind as an example from another domain.

TONIGHT ON THE CBS EVENING NEWS
  

Here's an early look at what we are working on for tonight's broadcast
of the CBS EVENING NEWS from Anchor and Managing Editor, Katie Couric...


Hi everyone, 

The House of Representatives this afternoon failed to override President
Bush's veto of the funding bill for Iraq that would have started
withdrawing troops by October 1. So what's next? While House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi has said Democrats will work with the White House to strike
a deal, but she's also said ""there is a great distance between us right
now."" Jim Axelrod will have the latest on the stalemate and David Martin
will report on the benchmarks that may be discussed for Iraq. 

Yesterday's immigration rallies across the United States were smaller
than last year's, but more than just harsh words were exchanged at some
of the protests. In Los Angeles, protesters scuffled with police, who
fired rubber cartridges and used batons against the crowd. Bill Whitaker
will more on the backlash from the clashes. 

There's good news for patients suffering from osteoporosis: a promising
new treatment that is given intravenously only once each year. Our
medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook will have the details. 

In other medical news, a soon-to-be released study shows an alarming
number of American children go without basic health care. Sharyl
Attkisson will have details. 

The role of peacekeepers in Darfur is changing, as our Allen Pizzey will
report from the Sudan. He'll have a story about the flow of funding and
the growing threat of militias against both cities and refugee camps
there. 

More than 100 journalists have died reporting on the war in Iraq, and
now a memorial is being dedicated to these journalists and other members
of the press killed in the line of duty since 1944, Richard Roth will
report. The memorial site: Normandy which, of course, was the first part
of France liberated by allied forces in World War II. 

And Barry Petersen will have a story on treating Internet addiction in
China for our series ""Caught in the Web."" 

I hope you'll join us. Katie

TONIGHT ON DAVID LETTERMAN   

Join Dave tonight on The Late Show with actress Drew Barrymore AND
impressionist Mike MacRae... Plus, musical guest Ben Kweller! 

________________________________


THURSDAY MORNING ON THE EARLY SHOW   

Harry Smith, Hannah Storm, Julie Chen and Russ Mitchell anchor THE EARLY
SHOW from New York. Dave Price will bring us the weather. 

Along with the top news of the day, we will also have the following
stories: 

TREATING BIPOLAR DISORDER IN CHILDREN: In the second part of our series
on children with bipolar disorder, we'll examine the case of
four-year-old Rebecca Riley. In December 2006, Rebecca died after
overdosing on her bipolar medications. Rebecca's parents, Carolyn and
Michael, are in jail facing first-degree murder charges in Plymouth
County, Massachusetts court. Prosecutors say Carolyn and Michael
intentionally overdosed their daughter, but defense attorneys argue her
parents were merely following doctor's orders. How is a
two-and-a-half-year-old diagnosed? EARLY SHOW National Correspondent
Tracy Smith reveals the dangerous side of a disorder; one that has
serious implications for treatment. 

SUMMER TRAVEL DESTINATIONS: Hard to believe, but summer is just around
the corner. Have you booked your summer vacation yet? It's not too late
to book your trip and still get a great deal. The editors at Travel &
Leisure magazine have a list of hot destinations that you can take
advantage of while you still can. Amy Farley, Senior Editor of Travel &
Leisure, will join us Thursday morning with her list. 

KIRSTEN DUNST ON SPIDERMAN 3: Exactly five years ago Thursday, Spiderman
made his way to theaters and changed the way movies were made. Not only
did it have groundbreaking special effects, but at the film's core was a
complex love story between Spidey's alter ego Peter Parker and his
childhood crush, Mary Jane Watson, played by Kirsten Dunst. In Spiderman
3, it looks like Peter and MJ are about to take their relationship to
the next level. After transitioning from child roles in Little Women,
and Interview with the Vampire, Kirsten Dunst has proven herself a very
versatile and mature actress. A favorite of the paparazzi, she has had a
number of rumored love interests in her off-screen life. Kirsten will
join us Thursday morning to talk about the latest in the trilogy. 

COOKING FOR SPRING WITH MARCUS SAMUELSSON: Cookbook author and Chef
Marcus Samuelsson has earned more accolades than most chefs will ever
receive in their lifetime. In 1995, he was the youngest chef ever
awarded a three-star review by The New York Times. In 1999, the James
Beard Foundation named him as a ""Rising Star Chef"". Thursday morning,
Samuelsson will join us with delicious spring recipes -- some of which
you can certainly find at his restaurant Aquavit in New York City. 

DREW BARRYMORE ON LUCKY YOU: From the time she appeared in ET, Drew
Barrymore has always had presence on-screen. From Charlie's Angels to
romantic comedies such as Never Been Kissed, Barrymore has gained a
legion of fans. Now, along with Eric Bana, she stars in Lucky You, a
drama set among the bright lights of Las Vegas. The film opens Friday.
Thursday morning, Barrymore will join us with the latest on her life and
her glitzy film. 

CSI PREVIEW: Thursday night's episode of CSI involves other-worldly
conspiracies and alien creatures from another planet. In our exclusive
""sneak peek"" you won't see anywhere else, Nick is looking for clues in a
location that couldn't be any more ""down-to-earth.""

state-of-the-art communication hardware and software technologies.

Is This an Undiscovered Gem that is Positioned to Go Higher? Review 
Exactly What this Company Does.

Breaking News!!

Tiger Team Technologies Corporation (TTMT) has had an extremely 
positive first half of year 2005. The company set out goals in the beginning 
of the year, but did not foresee the progress that it has made. So far 
this year the company has secured short term funding, receeived a clean 
bill of health from its auditors and is therefore ready to file the 
necessary paperwork with the SEC to move to a better exchange, and 
finally, as noted in the previous press release dated June 25, 2004, the 
company is now being aggressively marketed in the Pacific Rim. 

Therefore, because Tiger Team has made inroads with major online 
retailers and internet transaction processors and wants to better service its 
clients here in the US and now being recruited in the Pacific Rim, the 
company has opened a new office in the San Francisco Bay Area. This 
office will compliment the one currently located where the company is 
headquartered in St. Paul, Minnesota. The company continues to garner 
interest from many market sectors and companies around the globe; thus, an 
expansion was only a natural outcome of the amazzing growth experienced 
this year. 

Tiger Team Technologies Corporation (TTMT) is pleased to announce that 
it has entered into a marketing agreement with Modern World Media, a 
leading Japanese marketing gr0up , to promote its products and services 
in the Japanese and Asian markets. This deal opens a completely new 
avenue for potential revenue and exposure as Tiger Team now looks to expand 
beyond the U.S. borders. 

Having a consistent presence in these two markets can only enhance the 
company's stature and in the long run, its profitability. A satisfied 
Paul Hogan, CEO of Tiger Team Technologies, stated that ""the 0pp0rtunity 
for the company to introduce its products and services into the most 
sophisticated and fastest growing market in the world not only gives the 
company and international scope but will impact the company's bottom 
line in very significant ways for years to come. 

Modern World Media specializes in introducing new and innovative 
technologies to the Japanese and Asian markets, and is highly selective in 
the products and services that it chooses to introduce into the primary 
markets. Therefore, besides being excited about the prospects of having 
its product being marketed one of the fastest growing economic regions, 
Tiger Team also feels honored of having been chosen since the selection 
process by World Media is that stringent. 

About the Company

Tiger Team Technologies (T3), is a leading developer of proprietary 
technical and business processes transforming business operations of 
medical service providers through state-of-the-art communication hardware 
and software technologies. T3 has developed auditrac to track documents 
and transmissions in conjunction with an innovative risk management 
program through it Financial Services Unit to limit client exposure in the 
HIPAA environment. These processes guaranteee and secure electronic 
file transmission in accordance with federal mandated HIPAA compliance 
requirements. This translates to total patient privacy and security which 
is key to reducing the risk and exposure and thus 0ffer a reduction in 
medical premiums placed on providers. Based in St. Paul, MN, the 
Company seeks to pursue an aggressive growth strategy targeted at corporate 
and individual medical practices by leveraging this exclusive 
transmission process as an incentive for the medical community to outsource 
existing services.

Staff thought that if the 20 kw stays and the easements go, they can
probably get the votes in the Assembly.  The Senate could have problems with
the easements and RPS since both are near and dear to them.  If Angelides
bought off on the DA, they could probably live with it.  We need to look
into the 20 kw further.

I have used LM34DZ temp sensors a fair number of times and have found

BINGO.
This now works. I am surprised as I had found a few examples that 
appeared to show a normal hash table.

But this works and really could be part of the documentation as that 
part is a bit weak (IMHO).

Thanks again,

"Don,

AEP has informed us over the past couple of nights that they MUST HAVE tag numbers in order to do next day checkouts.  They claim that this has always been the case but we know that in the past we have not needed the tag #'s in order to check out. It appears AEP enjoys being difficult.  So it looks like going forward we will need tag numbers from the schedulers in order to check our properly with AEP.

Because things were quite inconsistently named before.  There were
instances of 'INTERP', 'interp' and 'interpreter' within the source
code and a TODO item was created (ages ago) to fix this problem and it
was decided to standardise everything to 'interp'.  I'm just doing
some extra cleanup.  I've not found any problems with build or tests,
hence why I checked this in.  Is there something I've missed?  Is this
causing problems somewhere?

Kevin,

I know you will find this hard to believe, but our Transaction Structure has changed once again.  We negotiated a new structure last night and I have put it on paper this morning.  Take a look and let me know if you have any questions.  I'm going to run this by Jeff and Mitch to get their confirmation and I'll let you know of any changes.

"Day 31
Date: Monday July 23, 2001
Distance: 99 miles
Moving average speed: 11.2 mph
Left at 8:00 AM
Arrived at 5:30 PM
Overnight in Wonder Rest Motel and Trailer Park, Cooperstown, ND
Latitude 47 d 26 m 32 s N
Longitude 98 d 7 m 24 s W
Cumulative distance: 2310 miles

Today after picking up my mail in Fargo (thanks, Maria!), I took my first bite out
of North Dakota.  I should mention that yesterday when I crossed the North Dakota
border I was once again deprived of the opportunity to take a photo of my bicycle
leaning against a ""Welcome to ..."" sign since Fargo, ND and Moorhead, MN have
basically merged into one city and like an old married couple it appears that they
don't bother to welcome each other anymore.

The morning went smoothly and just about as expected.  Almost as soon as you
leave Fargo you are on the great plains, and riding the great plains is like riding a
treadmill.  While the route parallels the railroad, you can play the game of spotting
a grain elevator on the horizion and watching as it imperceptibly gets closer, but
pretty soon the route leaves the railroad and you are deprived of any indication
that you are making progress except for the odometer.  The horizon is low and
you can often see the water tower in the next town five or six miles before you
get there.  You have to disabuse yourself of the notion that just because you can
see a place you must be close to it: at 12 mph it could take a half hour to go from
first sighting to arrival.

My goal for the great plains was to keep the average speed around 12.5 mph.  That
way eight hours of riding would carry me 100 miles and still leave an hour or two
for breaks or in case something interesting came along.  It's a pace I can manage
pretty easily even in moderately difficult conditions, but as you can see from the
header above I didn't come close today.  The reason is the wind.

I thought I had fought headwinds in Indiana and Illinois, but back then I didn't know
what a headwind was.  Around noon a wind started picking up coming directly from
the west; by 2 PM it was up to a steady 25-30 mph, right in my face.  In the great plains
the wind is relentless.  There's no shelter from it. and it has half a continent across
which it can blow freely without obstruction.  A strong headwind is very demoralizing.
No matter how hard you work you can't make any time, and unlike climbing a hill,
you won't get anything back.  It's a widely fluctuating load as the wind gusts up and
down, so it's hard to set a steady pace.  If the wind has any component perpendicular
to your direction of travel it will blow you off course forcing you to make constant
corrections.  There's no helping it: the wind will slow your progress to a creep.  I had
in mind to go another 25 miles today, but at 5:30 PM the wind was at full strength
and the last 10 miles had taken me an hour and a half.  At that rate, there simply
wasn't enough daylight left to go another 25 miles and set up camp once I got there.

As I was slogging along, I kept thinking that it is inconceivable that our country would
seriously consider drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge while thousands
of gigawatts blow across North Dakota untapped.  It's interesting that the wind reaches
its full strength in the early afternoon at exactly the same time when the demand for
electricity is at its peak.  I hope someday somebody in the utility business takes advantage
of this happy coincidence.

Day 32
Date: Tuesday July 24, 2001
Distance: 148 miles
Moving average speed: 15.5 mph
Left at 7:00 AM
Arrived at 7:00 PM
Overnight in Hillman Inn and Campground, Rugby, ND
Latitude 48 d 21 m 20 s N
Longitude 100 d 0 m 7 s W
Cumulative distance: 2458 miles

I made a point of getting an early start today so that I could get as much
riding in before the wind came up in the afternoon.  The route out of
Cooperstown, ND starts out due west and then turns north on state road 1,
and when I reached the northward stretch I started feeling pretty sluggish.
There's a small town just off of SR1 called Binford, reaching it meant a
detouring a mile off the route, but if there were coffee and pancakes in
Binford then the extra distance would be well worth it.

The cafe in Binford had a notebook for cyclists passing through to write
their name, departure point, destination and about a page describing their
trip.  Most of them wrote notes with recommendations for cyclists going
in the opposite direction, all of them praised the friendliness of the locals
and the pancakes in the cafe.  The notebook went all the way back to
1995.  It was interesting to see the wide variation in how cyclists were
reacting to the experience of riding across the US.  There was the resignation
of an eastbounder reaching Binford late in September and realizing that
there was no way she could finish before the weather in the mountain
passes would get too cold.  There was the euphoria of an eastbound
couple finishing up a round-the-world tour and claiming to average 100
miles per day (although the 1800 miles from Seattle had taken them 22 days).
There was one who was positively suicidal.  Numerous eastbounders
complained that they hadn't had any tailwinds yet.  One eastbounder in
1995 suggested taking US Route 2 from Devil's Lake to Rugby to shave
a little distance off the Adventure Cycling route (which picks up US 2
west of Rugby).  This turned out to be very bad advice.

I spent quite a while in Binford reading all the entries in the notebook and
taking copious notes on their suggestions.  When I finally got going again the
wind had already come up, but much to my surprise and delight it was a
tailwind today, just a little bit south of due east.  I took off like a bat out of
hell propelled by that tailwind, hoping to encounter some eastbounders so
that I could gloat about it.

Near Tokio, ND I encountered my first ""Road Closed"" sign of the day on State
Road 20.  There are only 638,800 people living in North Dakota, about half as
many as live within the city limits of Boston (not to mention the surrounding
towns and suburbs), in an area of 70,704 square miles.  A low population
density means a very sparse road network, and therefore any detour could
easily add forty miles to the day.  Naturally, there's no easy way to tell in
advance, you are just expected to follow the detour.  So I flagged down a
motorist going in the opposite direction and asked him if he knew why the
road was closed and if he thought I could get through on a bicycle.  He said
he didn't know why it was closed, he had no problem getting through in his
pickup, and I should certainly have no trouble on my bicycle.  This turned out
to be very bad advice.

The roads in the neighborhood of Devil's Lake (the lake, not the town) are built
on causeways through the surrounding wetlands and across the lake itself.  It was
the absence of one of these causeways (which was being rebuilt) that was the
reason for closing state road 20.  The local in the pickup truck who said I could get
through on my bicycle must have had a rather exaggerated opinion of my swimming
abilities.  Fortunately, the Adventure Cycling map showed a way to route around
the missing causeway that only cost me a couple of miles on gravel roads.

The south shore of Devil's Lake from the southeast, is the Spirit Lake
Nation, a Sioux Indian reservation (apparently ""Devil's Lake"" is a mistranslation
of a Sioux word more nearly approximated by ""Spirit Lake"").  The Sioux of
the Spirit Lake Nation have also noticed what I have been remarking on for
the past three or four states: in flat country such as this the wind is steady
and reliable enough to use for generating electricity.  It was in the Spirit  Lake
Nation that I saw a wind power turbine for the first time.  Apparently the Sioux
are using it to power their casino, judging by its location just outside the
parking lot.  I imagine the local rural electric cooperative simply didn't have
enough amps to supply the demands of a large scale hotel-casino, and so the
Nation erected a turbine to supplement it.

At this point, I decided to take another piece of really bad advice, which was
to detour off the Adventure Cycling route and pick up US 2 in Devil's Lake (the
town, not the lake) and follow it to Rugby (the town, not the sport) shaving
a few miles off the route and taking better advantage of the ESE tailwind.  After
all, Adventure Cycling was going to pick up US 2 west of Rugby and follow it
for a few hundred miles across western North Dakota and eastern Montana, so
how bad could it be?  Perhaps it was the image of that wind turbine that made
me think taking full advantage of the wind was the order of the day; at any rate
I would live to regret this decision.

For a four-lane, divided federal highway with a 65 mph speed limit, US 2 is in
pretty abominable condition.  The pavement is badly broken up, there isn't a hard
shoulder for most of the 60 miles between Devil's Lake and Rugby, and where there
is a hard shoulder six inches of grass has grown through the cracks.  This was bad
enough, but the worst was a stretch I hit between Penn and the junction with US
281 at Churchs Ferry.  I guess the DOT had come to the same conclusion I had
about the condition of the pavement, and had decided the best course of action
was to rip it all up and start over.  To this end, they had closed the two opposing
lanes on the eastbound side of the median, reversed the flow of traffic in the passing
lane on the westbound side and had two way two lane traffic for a good four miles.  
The only things that saved me were 1) North Dakota drivers are VERY considerate and
2) there aren't very many North Dakota drivers.  Even though US 2 is the only
east-west corridor across the northern part of the state, there still aren't enough people
living here to generate alot of traffic.

I had pretty much made up my mind to take US 281 south to Minnewaukan, pay the
11 mile penalty for my error of judgement, and forget about Rugby.  But guess what
sign I saw at the junction with 281?  ""Road Closed"" with a detour straight down US 2.
Arrgh.  At least I was out of the construction by then, and the next ten miles of US 2
must be what they ripped up and rebuilt last year because it was in excellent condition
with a wide, hard shoulder.  I guess what Andrew Howard says about Minnesota also
applies to North Dakota, ""There are two seasons: winter and road construction"".

In the end I decided to just grit my teeth and steam down US 2 as fast as I could to
get off of it before the sun was so low in the west that drivers would be blinded.
Fortunately, I had that wind behind me, so with some effort I was able to run through
the last 60 miles or so at 17-18 mph (hence the ridiculously high -- for a tourist --
average speed in the header above).  One begins to understand why some cyclists
choose to ride the interstates in Montana and North Dakota: the traffic isn't moving
much faster than it does on the secondary roads and at least there's always a hard
shoulder.

I'm spending tonight at a campground (which is an adjunct to a motel) in Rugby, the
geographical center of North America.  I think Alaska must be pulling the center a bit
to the west in the continental US since I am pretty sure that I'm more than half way to
Seattle: with 2450 miles down, there should only be about 1700 remaining.  And the
""geographical center"" seems to be remarkably close to the 100th meridian exactly ....
At any rate, there's a monument here marking the center which becomes a photo
opportunity when you lean a bicycle against it.

Day 33
Date: Wednesday July 25, 2001
Distance: 68 miles
Moving average speed: 15.2 mph
Left at 9:45 AM
Arrived at 3:00 PM
Overnight in Expressway Car Wash, Laundromat and Campground, Minot, ND
Latitude 48 d 13 m 46 s N
Longitude 101 d 15 m 6 s W
Cumulative distance: 2526 miles

I had a late start today since I knew it would be a short one.  I need to get myself
in phase with the places you can stop along the way.  Here in the wild west, the
population is so sparse you can't choose your daily mileages, you just go from one
town to the next and hope it's not too far.

By delaying my departure I gave the wind time to build up a bit, and who would
have guessed it but I got another day of bodacious tailwinds.  I bet those eastbounders
who flew from the east coast to the west coast to start their ride are really steamed
now.  But guess what the day consisted of?  68 miles of pure, solid US 2, this time
sanctioned by Adventure Cycling.  It's no different west of Rugby than it was to the
east; I've put in more than 120 miles on US 2 in the last two days and I'm thoroughly
sick of it now and plan to follow every single little detour off of it that Adventure Cycling 
recommends.  Locals inform me that US 2 is even worse in eastern Montana where it's
only two lanes wide, still with no shoulder.  That's acceptable to me as long as traffic is light.

They told me in Rugby that the North Dakota State Fair would be running in Minot
when I got here, and sure enough it is.  I spent most of the afternoon down there.  It's
everything you would expect from a state fair: carnival, crafts, livestock (a word of
caution to future cyclists in North Dakota with fancy cleat systems built into your
shoes: be very careful where you step in the livestock barns).  It seemed a shame to
squander the tailwind by spending the afternoon at the state fair instead of riding all
afternoon, but there is no place to stop within a reasonable distance of Minot if you
already have 68 miles on the odometer, so I have to just hope the wind doesn't turn
again tomorrow.

Day 34
Date: Thursday July 26, 2001
Distance: 81 miles
Moving average speed: 12.6 mph
Left at 9:00 AM
Arrived at 4:00 PM
Overnight in New Town Marina Campground, New Town, ND
Latitude 47 d 58 m 56 s N
Longitude 102 d 31 m 53 s W
Cumulative distance: 2607 miles

I had a miserable night last night.  My choice of campground was a very poor one:
although they had a laundromat and were convenient to the state fair they were
located right on the corner of US 2 and a major county road with a gas station that
was open all night.  It was one of those ""campgrounds"" that's really just a parking
lot for RVs with a few grassy patches at the edge where you can pitch a tent.  It
was very noisy; I hardly slept at all.

I had a late start after lingering in a cafe in Minot, and was pleasantly surprised to see
that the wind was still favorable, from the southeast today.  I was able to take pretty
good advantage of it except for the first twenty miles which were due south.  That
stretch was on US 83, which was a carbon copy of US 2 as far as riding conditions
are concerned.  I turned west on State Road 23, which was much better.

I'm getting into really empty country now.  It's the sort of place where they raise the
speed limits on the grounds that the greater danger is one of drivers falling asleep, not
high speed collisions.  Today I started with a 45 mile stretch where there were no
services whatsoever (no towns, no gas stations, no convenience stores, no potable
water, nothing).  Tomorrow starts with 70 such miles.  This is the price you pay to
leave the main road.  Eastern Montana won't be so bad because the route returns to
good ol' US 2, which is literally the only road you can take through that area.

Day 35
Distance: 76 miles
Moving average speed: 12.3 mph
Left at 9:45 AM
Arrived at 4:00 PM
Overnight in Travel Host Motel, Williston, ND
Latitude 48 d 10 m 49 s N
Longitude 103 d 37 m 37 s W
Cumulative distance: 2684 miles

Not much to report on today.  I crossed what I'm sure will turn out to be the
loneliest stretch of road on the trip: 72 miles from New Town to Williston, ND
in which there is not a single town.  The loneliness was relieved about 20 miles
out of New Town where I encountered two eastbounders: Bill Easley and his
son Todd are from Denver, CO and are riding from Anacortes to Bar Harbor
following the Northern Tier, on the road for 20 days when I encountered them.
Bill will have to finish alone as Todd has to return home to work in another 20
days.

STOCKS DISMISS EARLY APPREHENSIONS

Equity index futures climbed out of their early morning doldrums 
to point to a mixed open for stocks amid a cloudy earnings 
picture and higher-than-expected jobless claims data as the 
markets attempt to shake off the ongoing bioterrorism threat.

Shares of Texas Instruments (TXN,30,f2) were lower in premarket 
activity after the wireless chip titan reported a 3Q pro forma 
loss of $0.03 per share, $0.01 above the First Call consensus as 
global demand for wireless and telecom equipment products 
weakened further. The company estimated a pro forma loss of 
$0.09 per share in 4Q and declined to forecast when it would be 
profitable, but it said it sees a bottom in chip sales in 4Q.

Shares of Siebel Systems (SEBL,17.38,f1&f4) were also lower in 
the premarket session after the software concern reported 3Q 
earnings of $0.07 per share, below the Street's $0.09 mean 
forecast, and the company's CEO said that the post-attack 
environment has been extremely difficult. However, he expects 
business conditions to ripen in the second half of next year and 
said he was comfortable with analysts' 4Q estimates of 
$0.09-$0.14 per share.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD,9.66,f2) reported a 3Q 
loss, excluding charges of $0.28 per share, in line with the 
Street's estimate owing to a slower PC sales and price 
competition form rival Intel Corp. (INTC,25,f1&f4).

Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (LLY,75,f2) said 3Q earnings, 
excluding items, fell to $0.66 per share, matching the First 
Call consensus estimate, on a 43% decline in sales of its 
flagship antidepressant drug, Prozac, upon the expiration of its 
patent in August. Lilly warned that it expects growth to slow as 
a result of the faster-than-expected erosion of Prozac sales, 
with single-digit sales growth for fiscal year 2001 and fiscal 
year 2002.

Security systems and electronic conglomerate Tyco International 
(TYC,48,f2) said fiscal 4Q profits, excluding charges and items, 
were $0.86 per share, ahead of the $0.84 per share First Call 
consensus estimate. The company said sales in its electronics 
division waned amid a slowdown in telecommunications, but were 
offset by its fire and security systems and health care business 
units. Tyco reaffirmed its previous 1Q guidance of $0.72 per 
share.

Leading soft drink maker Coca-Cola (KO,44,f2) reported 3Q 
operating earnings of $0.43 per share, ahead of the $0.40 per 
share First Call mean estimate. The Dow component saw its 
benchmark unit case volumes grow in excess of 4% for the 
quarter.

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

Bonds were mixed to slightly higher after this morning's initial 
jobless claims release showed a 6,000 rise to 490,000 for the 
week ended Oct. 13 after an upward revision of 16,000 in the 
prior week, according to the Labor Department. Analysts per Dow 
Jones Newswires had forecast a rise to 472,000. The four-week 
moving average of claims rose to 491,250 and continuing claims 
through the week ended Oct. 6 rose to 3,649,000, the highest 
level in more than 18 years.

WORLD MARKETS 

Computer-related and telecommunications stocks led most European 
markets lower following last night's bleak earnings news in the 
U.S. The Bloomberg European 500 Index was down 1.2% as of 8:53 
a.m. EDT. SAP AG (SAP, 27) stoked the fire when the software 
giant reported a 3Q loss at the lower range of estimates and cut 
its fiscal year 2001 revenue estimates. The euro was lower 
against the dollar after Germany's finance minister slashed 
growth-rate estimates for the country for both 2001 and 2002. 
Moreover, European Central Bank officials said that they remain 
focused on containing inflation, raising speculation that the 
European Central Bank won't reduce interest rates soon enough.

Asian stocks were also under pressure, led by technology stocks 
on the heels of last night's gloomy earnings reports from Texas 
Instruments and Siebel Systems, driving names like NEC Corp. 
(NEC,9.60) and Hitachi Limited (HIT,75) lower. Japan's 
Nikkei-225 Index closed down 2.6%. The yen advanced against the 
dollar, even as Japan's finance minister said that the country 
must further weaken the Japanese currency and that an economic 
contraction was unavoidable.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the December Globex futures contract as of 8:53 a.m. EDT, the

value). The December DJIA futures contract was up 40 points (6 
points below fair value), and the November crude oil futures 
traded on the NYMEX were down $0.39 at $21.42/barrel.

I didn't think of unregistered marks. Yes, in that case it
gets more tricky. This is a mostly-US problem; the other
jurisdictions I know of simply do not recognize trademark
rights unless registered.

TINLA but I don't think that is necessary. Since the license
is ""do whatever you want as long as it doesn't confuse people
with us"", you simply argue differently when you think there
is confusion.

For the open use logo, you would say there is confusion only
when people try to indicate endorsement by Debian.

For the official use logo you would say there is confusion
also when people pretend whatever they have is Official Debian.

Yes, these are vague criteria but that is to a certain extent
inherent in trademark law. You don't know what people will do
and how that can affect your trademark.

I don't know what you mean by that. 

The wording with X and Z seems to suggest that you mean that
X can only be a trademark for Z (""representing Z""). So there
can only be confusion when people use X representing Z, right?

Now suppose three years from now X also becomes known to
represent T. With your license, can you still argue that
X is being misused when people use it to represent T, falsely
pretending affiliation with X? I'm not sure, because the license
says that X only represents Z.

> I'd rather avoid the latter, even at the cost of risking the former!

I understand that. It's difficult to allow other people to do
things with your trademark, because it is easy to permit too much
and that can kill your trademark. It's not like copyright where
a too-liberal license means someone can use it in a way you don't
like; there you still have your free original.

"Welcome to ""Ghetto"" America!
...Yes, you heard me; I said ""Ghetto"" America! What is ""Ghetto"" 
America, I'm glad you asked. Before I go on please be warned, 
this explanation may not sit well with many of you, however it is 
no less true! ""Ghetto"" America is a society of individuals 
comprised primarily of African Americans who represent the 
impoverished, and often unpolished side of ""Black America;"" 
Confused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a 
typical ghetto community; namely the ""projects"" and noticed an 
unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular 
neighborhood, and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have 
been to a shopping mall, and noticed an unusual amount of young 
""teen looking"" black women carrying infants, or pushing baby 
carriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also 
noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying 
them. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the 
absence of the all important ""wedding band"" missing from their 
respective ring fingers!"" .And of course we have all heard 
stories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly 
mugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know 
that many young African American women refuse to date African 
American males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In 
fact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who 
represent the subversive side of society; commonly known as 
""Thugs"" or ""Street Hustlers;"" Also, did you know that many young 
African American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while 
living in government housing better known as the ""projects"" 
rather than move away, purchase new homes, save, or even make 
investments?
 
    ""Attention"" This is Not another ""Boyz in the Hood"" Story!
 
These newly distinguished ""Black Generation Xers"" are suffering 
through utter chaos. ""Baby Makers, Loser choosers, Welfare 
Abusers...Images of My America"" is a collection of observations, 
and commentary as told through the eyes of a young African 
American Male who experienced, and perpetuated many of the truths 
that many in ""Black America,"" and the world in general would have 
you believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds 
light on the oppressive, and often discriminatory nature of 
""Mainstream American Society."" A society that has nurtured the 
rampant disregards for self-respect, and enlightenment that many 
young African American men, and women currently suffer from. The 
writer supports his arguments with direct references to the 
overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to 
raise children, with many being teens themselves; and the foolish 
criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes 
being based on nothing more than the young black male's tough or 
cool neighborhood reputation.
 
The author also identifies the self-destructive and often 
criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily 
basis like, refusing to pursue higher education, carrying guns, 
robbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving fancy cars, and wearing 
expensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior 
committed by both males, and females is due in large part to a 
lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless 
homes. These poor choices, and behavioral disorders coupled with 
the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in 
the form of welfare abuse, and over crowded prison populations 
are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty, and lack 
of direction that currently exists in young ""Black America"" 
today. To learn more about this dynamic self contained society

"From The Desk of:Thomas Graham Head of Trustee and Depository Institutional Fund ServiceS.HSBC Bank Plc 24th Floor8 Canada SquareLondon E14 5hq.E-MAIL: htdifshsbcbankplc@yahoo.co.in19th Of March 2005. Dear Sir, Compliment of the season to you. I am Mr.Thomas Graham Head of Trustee and DepositoryInstitutional Fund Services HSBC Bank London,I amcontacting you concerning a deceased customer,and aninvestment he placed under our banks management 3yearsago.I would respectfully request that you keep the contentsof this mail confidential and respect the integrity of theinformation you come by as a result of this mail. I contact you independently and no one is informed of thiscommunication.I would like to intimate you with certainfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In 2000,the subject matter came to our bank to engage in businessdiscussions with our Trustee and Depository InstitutionalFund Services division HSBC . He informed us that he had afinancial portfolio of 14.5 million British PoundsSterling, which he wished to have us turn over (invest) onhis behalf.I was the officer assigned to his case,I madenumerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-factochief operations officer of Trustee and DepositoryInstitutional Fund Services division HSBC, especially giventhe volume of funds he wished to put into our division. Based on my advice, We spun the money around variousopportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation,the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over 6 millionBritish Pounds Sterling,this margin was not the fullpotential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteedreturns on investments. I informed him that HSBC Bank Plc London would have to makespecial arrangements to have this done and in order not tocircumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 %deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutorycharges. He complained about the charges but later camearound when I explained to him the complexities of the taskhe was asking of us. Large cash movements have becomeespecially strict since the incidents of 9/11. I contactedmy affiliate and had the funds available as he hadrequested. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed hisprecise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited witha security consultancy firm.This security firm is anespecially private firm that accepts deposits from high networth individuals and blue chip corporations that handlevaluable products or undertake transactions that needimmediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiarespecially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In Linewith instructions,the money was deposited with them.He told mehe wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrivalfrom Norway later that week. This was the lastcommunication we had, this transpired around 25th February2004. I was the only one who knew about the deposit at thesecurity company, and I could not understand why our client had not comeforward to claim his deposit.I made futile efforts tolocate him,and i immediately passed the task of locatinghim to the internal investigations department of HSBC BankPlc.Four days later, information started to trickle in,apparently our man was dead. A person who suited hisdescription was declared dead of a heart attack in Canne,South of France. We were soon enough able to confirm all ofthis including cause of death. The bank immediatelylaunched an investigation into possible surviving next ofkin to alert about the situation and also to come forwardto claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those whopatronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levelsof detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-dataform, he listed no next of kin.opening an account with usmeans no one will know of its existence,accounts are rarelyheld under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to makethe accounts anonymous.It is quite clear now that our dearfellow died with no known or identifiable family members.This leaves me as the only person with the full picture ofwhat the prevailing situation is in relation to the depositand the late beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice,the security company will by the endof this yearbroadcast a request for statements of claim to HSBC Bankplc, failing to receive viable claims they will mostprobably revert the deposit to HSBC Bank Plc. This willresult in the money entering the HSBC Bank Plc accountingsystem . What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethicalpractice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider tothe banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking worldberrational. The world of Trustee and DepositoryInstitutional Fund Services division HSBC especially isfraught with huge rewards for those who sit upon certainchairs and oversee certain portfolios. You should havebegun by now to put together the general direction of whatI propose. There is 14,500,000.00 deposited in a security company.Ialone have the deposit details and they will release thedeposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to trackthis man's family; they have investigated for months and have found nofamily. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you sharesimilar details to the late fellow;I am prepared toinstruct the security company to release the deposit to youas the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of thedeposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half.That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin andhave them release the deposit to you.We share the proceeds45/45,while 10% is been maped out incase of any expenses aswe proceed into this MUTUAL transaction. You with the samevery name as the original depositor would easily pass asthe beneficiary with right to claim.I assure you that Icould have the deposit released to you within a few days.Iwill simply inform the bank of the final closing of thefile relating to our late client.I will then officiallycommunicate with the security company and instruct them torelease the deposit to you.With these two things: all isdone. The alternative would be for us to have the securitycompany direct thefunds to another bank with you as account holder.This waythere will beno need for you to think of receiving the money directlyfrom the security company as it is not a conventionalfinancial institution; they accept deposits from onlyorganizations thus; what you hand over to them is what youget back. They do not have the means to process the money.Iask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not workwith me let me know and let me move on with my life but donot destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to providethem with new opportunities.There is a reward for thisproject and it is a task well worth undertaking.I haveevaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is fromyou refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only one who knows of this situation, good fortunehas blessedyou with a name that has planted you into the center ofrelevance in mylife. Lets share the blessing.If you find yourself able towork with me,contact me A.S.A.P. If you give me positive signals,Iwill give you the relevant details and initiate thisprocess towards a conclusion.Please, again, note I am a family man,I have wife andchildren.I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what theonsequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured isnothing gained and that success and riches never come easyor on a platter of gold.This is the one truth I havelearned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence.Sincerly,Thomas Graham ALTERNATIVE E-Mail address: htdifshsbcbankplc@yahoo.co.in-----------------------------------------------------------------------Ya puedes ganar con la bolsa sin arriesgar ni un céntimo.

"Drug Coated Stents - Health Alert Newsletter - May 7th, 2007  



The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, have cited studies showing 

that drug-coated stent recipients face an increased risk of blood-clots. 



Drug-coated stents, which are sold in the U.S. by Boston Scientific and 

Johnson & Johnson, are designed to prevent scar tissue from forming in 

arteries after angioplasty. However, recent studies have suggested 

the devices might increase the risk of blood clots compared with bare-metal stents.



Drug-coated stents have been placed in about 6 million people worldwide. 



If you or someone you know has had a drug-coated stent implanted they may be at risk. 

If so, you or that someone may be entitled to monetary damages.

I think the problem is the wacky directory names that end up  
happening in core when we find the perl interpreter.  Things like ""/ 
Users/ken/Downloads/perl/bleadperl/t/_tmp.2161/Simple/../../../ 
perl"".  Then when we remove that tempdir, it can't find perl  
anymore.  One solution would be to collapse that down to ""/Users/ken/ 
Downloads/perl/bleadperl/perl"".  Not sure if that's the right  
solution though.

The following band-aid will get blead working, at least.

OK, I think I begin to see your point and which is the question the
Debian Project has to answer: should people be allowed to use the
Official Use Logo on anything, as long as endorsement is not claimed?

I think I must stop for a while and wait for some opinions from DDs
(which I am not...), before going on with the proposed trademark license
text.
Also, a clarification by Nathanael on what he meant to achieve with his
original proposal would be useful: Nathanael, did you intend to allow or
forbid the above-outlined scenario?

i have a group of people working on various issues that are interdependent .
this was a chance for
them to hear progress from the different areas . we included it because most
of our issues are dependent

The get_ standard entered with namespaces, and was itself a modification 
of the find_ standard from the earlier opcodes for dealing with globals 
and lexicals. For methods, I'd say the underscores are standard. For 
opcoess, it's debatable whether underscores or no underscores is 
standard at this point. I made a note to review it when I get to the 
Opcodes PDD.

This is the same question we have for I/O, and really for large parts of 
Parrot. I've temporarily held off on this decision until the new 
exceptions PDD is implemented (widespread exceptions really aren't 
practical with the current exceptions implementation).

Yeah, that could work. A pseudo-variable like 'self' in every method. Or,

   self.super.""foo""()

Also a good candidate. Or, to only modify PIR syntax in one spot,

   self.next.""foo""()

Great thoughts, thanks!

It's much easier to write this sort of infrastructure in perl. It
would be hard (and complex) to write it (portably) in shell script.

Anatrim  The up-to-the-moment and most enchanting product for over-weight people is now readily available  As could be seen on BBC.

Can you remember all the times when you appeal to yourself to do anything for being saved from this fastly growing number of kilos? Happily, now no big sacrifice is necessary. With Anatrim, the ground-shaking pound-melting blend, you can achieve healthier mode of life and become really slimmer. Have a look at what our customers say!

""Its difficult to admit it but I was a junk food addict. 

I greedily swallowed up all this garbige 

and just could not stop. 

This torment ceased when I started course with Anatrim! 

God,

 my craving for food decreased, 

mood increased and Im the happiest person 18 pounds in 2.9 months. 

I can tell you now Im the happiest person!""
 

Amely S., Boston

 
""I had weight problems since a boy. 

You can't even fancy how I hated being derided at school. 

I detested my weight and I detested even myself. 

After trying many different remedies I heard about Anatrim. 

It literally took me out of this terrible nightmare! The greatest respect to you, fellows.""

 
Steve Doubt, Bellevue WA

 
""You know what? Thanks to Anatrim my marriage was luckily saved! I got into the circle, depression  eating more  even more depression. My wife was going to leave the overweight psycho I was turning in. 

One my best friend pointed at your web page and I ordered pack of Anatrim at the time. 

The result was splendid, my appetite came to acceptable level, I was often in good spirits, and, certainly, I went some belt holes back. And you see me, the bedroom became cool, too!""

 
Jack

 There is a great number of gratitudes left by happy people taking Anatrim. Dont you gonna add yourself to the tens of thousands of slim customers and take this original appetite-suppressing energy increasing product now!

"request for urgent business relationship
dear sir ,
firstly , i must solicit your strictest confidentiality
in this transaction . this is by virtue of its nature
as being utterly confidential and  top secret . 
though i know that a transaction of this magnitude
will make anyone apprehensive and worried , but i am
assuring you that all will be well at the end of the
day .
we have decided to contact you first by your email due
to the urgency of this transaction , as we have been
reliably informed that it will take at least two to
three weeks for a normal post to reach you . so we
decided it is best using the email .
let me start by first introducing myself properly to
you . i am dr . osaro ame , a director general in the
ministry of mines and power and i head a three - man
tender board appointed by the government of the
federal republic of nigeria to award contracts to
individuals and companies and to approve such contract
payments in the ministry of mines and power . the
duties of the committee also include evaluation ,
vetting and monitoring of work done by both foreign
and local contractors in the ministry .
i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
business transaction which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring
maximum confidence . in order to commence this
business , we solicit for your assistance to enable us
transfer into your account the said funds .
the source of this funds is as follows : between 1996
and 1997 , this committee awarded contracts to various
contractors for engineering , procurement , supply of
electrical equipments such as transformers , and some
rural electrification projects .
however , these contracts were over - invoiced by the
committee , thereby , leaving the sum of us $ 11 . 5 million
dollars ( eleven million five hundred thousand united
states dollars ) in excess . this was done with the
intention that the committee will share the excess
when the payments are approved .
the federal government have since approved the total
contract sum which has been paid out to the companies
and contractors concerned which executed the
contracts , leaving the balance of $ 11 . 5 m dollars ,
which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe
off - shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst
ourselves .
we need your assistance as the funds are presently
secured in an escrow account of the federal government
specifically set aside for the settlement of
outstanding payments to foreign contractors . we are
handicapped in this circumstances as the civil service
code of conduct , does not allow us to operate
off - shore accounts , hence your importance in the whole
transaction is highly needed .
my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your
company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on
our behalf , you or your company will retain 20 % of the
total amount of us $ 11 , 500 , 000 . 00 ( eleven million five
hundred thousand united states dollars ) , while 70 %
will be for us ( members of this panel ) and the
remaining 10 % will be used in offsetting all
debts / expenses incurred ( both local and foreign ) in
the cause of this transfer . needless to say , the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous . in return
we demand your complete honesty and trust .
it does not matter whether or not your company does
contract projects of this nature described here , the
assumption is that your company won the major contract
and sub - contracted it out to other companies . more
often than not , big trading companies or firms of
unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract
to more specialized firms for execution of such
contracts . we are civil servants and we will not
want to miss this once in a life time opportunity .
you must however , note that this transaction will be
strictly based on the following terms and conditions
as we have stated below , as we have heard confirmed
cases of business associates running away with funds
kept in their custody when it finally arrive their
accounts . we have decided that this transaction will
be based completely on the following :
( a ) . our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence .
( b ) . that you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality .
( c ) . that upon receipt of the funds , you will promptly
release our share ( 70 % ) on demand after you have
removed your 20 % and all expenses have been settled .
( d ) . you must be ready to produce us with enough
information about yourself to put our minds at rest .
please , note that this transaction is 100 % legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude the business in ten
bank working days from the date of receipt of the
necessary information and requirement from you .
endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter
using my email fax number 1 - 443 - 658 - 2542 or my email
address and i will bring you into the complete picture
of this transaction when i have heard from you .
your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we
are already behind schedule for this financial
quarter .
thank you and god bless .
yours faithfully ,
dr . osaro ame

recent news and major share - price driving milestones :
geec just announced a $ 10 billion , 5 - year joint venture

geec uses their biosphere process system to convert various

speaking of which, compiling Samba without ldap is harder than it
seems. I found I had to remove the ldap libs from my system to prevent
it from building with ldap. The --with-ldap=no configure flag didn't
seem to work? 

Has anyone else noticed this?

Hi Paul,

I don't know how the handyboard is protected against overload but one
thing is for sure : if you overload the driver chip ... this one will
fry up.In worst case you'll fry the board as well.

If a driver chip's maximum current is 1 Amp. then don't go over this limit!
Also, if possible,place a heathsink on the driver chip surface, this will
keep the chip 'cooler' and protect it better against thermal breakdown.

Uncooled is the output current much lower than cooled.
For more details (if possible) check the data sheets from the driver chip.

"   I put together the HB shortly after it first became available.   This is
key because it worked-downloading and  all.
   I put it down for a year because of family problems but all that time left
it plugged in because of the Ni-cad.   I feel that should make no difference
but now to the problem.   IT WILL not tale a download no how no way.   My MAC
OS  8 comjper will not see the Handy Board or often will load 255 bytes but
not the 256th-the last one.
  If one tried 15 times the init board from the Freeware IC it would take that
so I was running IC 2.81 1993.
  I then got the Commercial; version from Newton Labs and now nothing.
Interestingly-and maybe a pointer to the problem-with the IC3.1-when I try to
reload the P code-the HB's green light will NOT go out as it must for the HB
to be in Downloadmode.(IT still stays on for a 1/3 of sec. with the freeware
version but will not take DL anymore no matter how many times I try.   I just
bought a new telephone 4 wire cable-it makes no difference.

  When you try a DL you see the blinking green light on the serial interface-
the Maxam chip seems to have the proper voltages.    

 I  STUMPED-bad 32k memory? The only other clue was using the the MC
downloader-and at one point I got an error message  Apple talk driver open
error-port not configured-but Apple talk was not on nor is it ever.  I have
not been the MC dopwnloader-I just tried it to see-  none of the DLer maske

"THE CHAIRMAN ECOWAS CONTRACT
AWARDING COMMITTEE
ECOWAS HEADQUATERS
ACCRA GHANA
WEST AFRICA.

I am Mr.Kazeem Ahmed,the Chairman of ECOWAS contract awarding committee in
ecowas sub-regional head quarter in Accra Ghana, West Africa. In due respect
and
regard, I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be
very beneficial to both of us
at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in my
department,we discovered a huge sum of money that was over invoiced
amounting $35,000,000.00 and un-recorded for in the books of Accounts.We
discovered that it has been floating since 1997 through 2001 in
international
Bank of Africa Accra Ghana. this is found out to be over influence on
contract
payments and over invoice. Personally the information is kept secret by me
and
my partner to enable the whole plan and ideas profitable and successful
during
the time of execution. As it may interest you to know, I got your contact
through business inquires from the  chamber of commerce here in my country
as I
was making contact for an honest foreigner who will assist me in this
transaction.
Meanwhile the whole arrangements to put claim over this fund, as a payment
of
contract executed since it cannot be withdrawn locally and get the required
approval and transfer this money to a foreign account
has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed
to
you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assits us and
also
benefit yourself in this great business
opportunity. In fact I could have done this alone but because of my position
in
this country as a civil servant we are not allowed to operate a foreign
account
and would eventually raise an eyebrow on my
side during the time of transfer. This is the actual reason why it will
require
a second party or fellow, who will forward claim as the
contractor and also present a foreign account where the money would be
tranferred to as a payment for contract executed as it may be after due
verification by designated board.  I would not fail to inform you that this
transaction is 100% risk-free. On smooth conclussion of this
transaction, you would be entitlled to 30% as gratification,while 5% will be
set
aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer
and
also telephone bills, while 65% will be for me and
my partners.
Please, you have been advise to keep top-secret as we are still in service
and
intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will
be
monitoring the whole situation here until you confirm the money in your
account,and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing
according
to percentages.  All other necessary information will be sent to you when I
hear
from you. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish
in
this deal.
Yours Faithfully,
Mr. Kazeem Ahmed
CHAIRMAN ECOWAS CONTRACT
AWARDING COMMITTEE.

"Not an answer to the question, but one of my most hilarious memories.

In the late 80s a damning bio of, I believe, John Lennon (maybe Geo 
Harrison, I can't recall) came out, and Saturday Night Live did what 
they do best, by portraying this man's past and what made him so hateful 
toward the Beatles.  Seems when they first started, there was a 5th 
Beatle.  And there was a scene of the 5 Beatles playing, panning from 
left to right, toward the 5th Beatle, and when the camera hit him 
(played by the much-missed late Phil Hartman) for his solo, it was the 
man who eventually wrote the bio.  And his instrument?  TROMBONE!

">From what I've read (which isn't much), the idea is to estimate a
utility (preference) function for discrete categories, using logistic
regression, under the assumption that the residuals of the linear
predictor of the utilities are ~ Type I Gumbel. This implies the
""independence of irrelevant alternatives"" in economic jargon. ie the
utility of choice a versus choice b is independent of the introduction
of a third choice c. It also implies homoscedasticity of the errors. The
model can be generalized in various ways. If you are willing to
introduce extra parameters into the model, such as the parameters of the
Gumbel distribution, you may get more precision in the estimates of the
utility function. An alternative (without the independence of irrelevant
alternatives assumption) is to model the errors as multivariate normal
(ie use probit regression), which is computationally much more
difficult.

Whether it makes substantive sense to use these models outside of
""discrete choice"" experiments is another question.

 Patenting these methods is worrying. There have been a lot of people
working on discrete choice experiments over the years. It's hard to
believe that a single company could have ownership over an idea that is
the result of a collaborative effort such as this.

Cheers,

Simon.

Thanks for the advice on the ouput compare and portA.  What I realized was the CPU time is being shared by some many functions, like the LCD printing, IR, PWM, that I'm not getting a fast enough pulse from the motor ports.  I disabled a lot of these features, and the stepper motors turned faster, but still not fast enough.  I tried doing bit_set and bit_clr on the pins you told me, and it works, but I think the problem is that I'm still working inside the interpreter, which slows down the pulsing.  I'm not sure if I can use the PWM somehow to do the pulsing.  Do you or does anyone know if I can vary the freq. of the PWM so I can use that as a clocking signal?   For incorporating assembly code, does the interpreter bypass that code and thus allow me to perform those functions faster? I'm not too sure how IC handles assembly code.

Thanks again for your help.

We need to verify with Joe what the name should be.  They acquired these firms and I'm not sure how the document should be drafted.

Assuming that you have a list of IP addresses you want to skip in @ip,
you could say

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

OUTER:
while() {
   my ($time, $lport, $ip, $stats, $rport) = split;
   for my $skip_ip (@ip) {
      next OUTER if $ip eq $skip_ip;

   # using those values above to create hash

"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- CERT Advisory CA-2003-02 Double-Free Bug in CVS Server    Original issue date: January 22, 2003    Last revised: --    Source: CERT/CC    A complete revision history is at the end of this file. Systems Affected      * Systems running CVS Home project versions of CVS prior to 1.11.5      * Operating system distributions that provide CVS      * Source code repositories managed by CVS      * For detailed vendor status information, see VU#650937:           Overview    A  ""double-free"" vulnerability in the Concurrent Versions System (CVS)    server  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker with read-only    access  to  execute  arbitrary  code,  alter  program  operation, read    sensitive information, or cause a denial of service. I. Description    CVS  is a version control and collaboration system that is widely used    by   open-source   software  development  projects.  CVS  is  commonly    configured  to  allow  public,  anonymous,  read-only  access  via the    Internet.    The  CVS  server component contains a ""double-free"" vulnerability that    can  be  triggered  by  a set of specially crafted directory requests.    While processing these requests, an error-checking routine may attempt    to  free()  the same memory reference more than once. Deallocating the    already freed memory leads to heap corruption, which an attacker could    leverage to execute arbitrary code, alter the logical operation of the    CVS server program, or read sensitive information stored in memory. In    most  cases,  heap  corruption  will  result  in a segmentation fault,    causing a denial of service.    The  CVS  server process is typically started by the Internet services    daemon  (inetd) and runs with root privileges. Arbitrary code inserted    by an attacker would therefore run with root privileges.    The CERT/CC is tracking this issue as VU#650937:          This reference number corresponds to CVE candidate CAN-2002-0059:          This issue was researched and reported by Stefan Esser of    e-matters:       II. Impact    Depending   on   configuration,   operating   system,   and   platform    architecture,  a remote attacker with anonymous, read-only access to a    vulnerable   CVS  server  could  execute  arbitrary  code,  alter  the    operation  of the server program, read sensitive information, or cause    a  denial of service. There is also a significant secondary impact. An    attacker  who  is  able  to  compromise  a  CVS  server  could  modify    source-code repositories to contain Trojan horses, backdoors, or other    malicious code. III. Solution Apply a patch or upgrade    Apply  the  appropriate  patch or upgrade as specified by your vendor.    See  Appendix  A.  below and the Systems Affected section of VU#650937    for further information:       Disable or restrict anonymous CVS access    As  a  temporary solution until patches or upgrades can be applied, or    to  improve the security of CVS servers in the long term, consider the    following workarounds and configurations:      * Disable anonymous CVS server access completely.      * Block  or  restrict access to CVS servers from untrusted hosts and        networks.  Anonymous  access  to CVS servers using :cvspserver: is        typically provided on port 2401/tcp.      * Configure CVS servers to run in restricted (chroot) environments.      * Host CVS servers on single-purpose, secured systems.    These  workarounds  and  configurations are not complete solutions and    will  not  prevent  exploitation of this vulnerability. Other features    inherent  in  CVS  may  give anonymous users the ability to gain shell    access. Appendix A. Vendor Information    This  appendix  contains information provided by vendors. When vendors    report  new  information,  this section is updated and the changes are    noted  in  the  revision  history. If a vendor is not listed below, we    have  not  received  their  comments.  The Systems Affected section of    VU#650937 contains additional vendor status information:      Conectiva      Conectiva  Linux is affected by this issue and updated packages are      available at :            6.0/SRPMS/cvs-1.10.8-5U60_3cl.src.rpm      6.0/RPMS/cvs-1.10.8-5U60_3cl.i386.rpm      6.0/RPMS/cvs-doc-1.10.8-5U60_3cl.i386.rpm      7.0/SRPMS/cvs-1.11-7U70_2cl.src.rpm      7.0/RPMS/cvs-1.11-7U70_2cl.i386.rpm      7.0/RPMS/cvs-doc-1.11-7U70_2cl.i386.rpm      8/SRPMS/cvs-1.11-9U80_2cl.i386.rpm      8/RPMS/cvs-1.11-9U80_2cl.i386.rpm      8/RPMS/cvs-doc-1.11-9U80_2cl.i386.rpm            An official announcement is pending and will show up in our updates      website at        shortly. Cray Inc.      Cray  Inc.  supports  CVS  through  their  Cray Open Software (COS)      package.  COS  3.3  and  earlier  is  vulnerable. A new CVS will be      available   shortly.   Please   contact  your  local  Cray  service      representative if you need this new package. CVS Home      CVS  release  1.11.5  addresses  this  issue  for  CVS servers. CVS      clients are not affected. Debian      Debian has updated their distribution with DSA 233.            For  the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in      version 1.11.1p1debian-8.1.      For  the  old  stable  distribution  (potato) this problem has been      fixed in version 1.10.7-9.2.      For  the  unstable  distribution  (sid)  this problem will be fixed      soon. Hewlett-Packard      SOURCE:  Hewlett-Packard Company and Compaq Computer Corporation, a      wholly-owned subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard Company            RE: x-reference SSRT3463            Not Vulnerable:            HP-UX      HP-MPE/ix      HP Tru64 UNIX      HP NonStop Servers      HP OpenVMS            To  report  any  security  issue  for any HP software products send      email to  IBM      The  AIX  operating  system does not ship with CVS. However, CVS is      available for installation on AIX from the Linux Affinity Toolbox.      CVS  versions  1.11.1p1-2  and earlier are vulnerable to the issues      discussed  in  CERT Vulnerability Note VU#650937 and any advisories      which follow.      Users are advised to download CVS 1.11.1p1-3 from:                  Please note that the above address was wrapped to two lines.      CVS  1.11.1p1-3  contains  the security fixes made in CVS 1.11.5 to      address these issues.      This software is offered on an ""as-is"" basis. Openwall GNU/*/Linux      We  don't  yet  re-distribute  CVS  in Openwall GNU/*/Linux. We do,      however,  provide  public  anonymous  CVS  access  to a copy of our      repository,  hosted  off  a  separate machine and in a chroot jail.      This  kind  of vulnerabilities in CVS was expected, and our anoncvs      setup  is  mostly  resistant  to  them:  read-only  access  to  the      repository  is  achieved  primarily  with  the  use of regular Unix      permissions,  not  controls  built  into CVS. CVS LockDir option is      used  to  direct  CVS  lock  files  to  a  separate directory tree,      actually  writable  to  the  pseudo-user. Nevertheless, the anoncvs      server  has  been  upgraded  to CVS 1.11.5 a few hours after it was      released. Red Hat, Inc.      Red  Hat Linux and Red Hat Linux Advanced Server shipped with a cvs      package  vulnerable  to  these  issues.  New  cvs  packages are now      available  along  with our advisory at the URLs below. Users of the      Red Hat Network can update their systems using the 'up2date' tool.      Red Hat Linux Advanced Server:            Red Hat Linux:       Sun Microsystems Inc.      Sun  does not include CVS with Solaris and therefore Solaris is not      affected by this issue.      Sun  Linux,  versions  5.0.3 and below, does ship with a vulnerable      CVS  package.  Sun  recommends  that  CVS  services  be disabled on      affected  Sun  Linux  systems  until patches are available for this      issue.      Sun  will  be  publishing  a Sun Alert for Sun Linux describing the      patch information which will be available from:       Appendix B.

"Dear HelpeRs,

I'm very fond of Sweave and I use it as often as possible.  It'a a pity
I can't use it for larger projects or can I?

For instance suppose I have three files file1.rnw, file2.rnw and
file3.rnw with Sweave code.  Working on file2.rnw I whould like to
exclude file1.rnw and file3.rnw temporarily and joining all of them
later.  This amounts to a mechanism similar to using LaTeX's \\include
command.  *Is* there a way to achieve that?

Thank you in advance.

"CHINA GOLD CORP Symbol: CGDC Current Price: 2.03 A Company engaged in gold and minerals exploration and development of gold and mineral properties in China. Why consider CHINA GOLD CORP (CGDC)? Seee n0wadays what happened. ∙ Rising gold prices are further accelerating this gold rush - The price of gold has up 250% over the past five years, and this is still only a quarter of when the price peaked 25 years ago. (Adjusted for inflation.) ∙ HUGE gold discovery in southwestern China - Resources have already been estimated by analysts at 14 million ounces...and the number keeps climbing. ∙ China is the world's last great under-explored land-mass - Locked away in a Marxist time-warp with limited exploration technology, China's rich virgin gold fields have been overlooked and ignored until recently. ∙ China is already the world's 4th largest producer of gold ≈ and will soon be the world's #1 producer AND #1 consumer. The country is going gold-crazy! ∙ Foreign gold companies are now welcome - and the laws have been changed to provide full legal protection. You can see China's developing gold boom is building momentum. Rare opportunity for early investors!! CURRENT NEWS: CHINA GOLD CORP (CGDC) Announces Five for One Forward Stock Split CHINA GOLD CORP is a Nevada Corporation, engaged in gold and minerals exploration and development of gold and mineral properties in China. The company is pleased to announce today that the board of directors has approved a five-for-one forward stock split.

Conclusion: The Example Above Show The Awesome, Earning Potential of Little Known Company That Explode Onto Investor's Radar Screens; Many of You Are Already Familiar with This.

Dear,

I am Dr. M. Z. Erick, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an
Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural
Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you
for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to
Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that
a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at
the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave
your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a
confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described
hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a
top secret because of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials,
we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six
Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars which we want to transfer
abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual
to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company
account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the
circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not
allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole
transaction.

This amount (Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand) represents the
balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by
a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced
deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the
original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount
which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic
Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in
an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the
transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence
provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send
across to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be
willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25%
of the Twenty-Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars, 70% for us
and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is
100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and
confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to
the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence
in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me
immediately through my above Tel/Fax number or my e-mail address, whether
or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me
scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure
you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of
this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and
guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this
matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with
any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and
remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

Dr. M. Z. Erick

Hi everyone,

 

Hamas has taken almost complete control over the Gaza Strip and is
claiming its ""liberation"" as government fighters retreat. President
Mahmoud Abbas dissolved the Palestinian government today and declared a
state of emergency and at least 20 Palestinians have died in the latest
battles. Richard Roth will have the latest from Israel and Bill Plante
will report from the White House on what the U.S. government's next move
may be. 

 

In Washington, a judge ruled that ""Scooter"" Libby, Vice President
Cheney's former chief of staff, cannot remain free while appealing his
sentence - he must spend the time in jail. Bob Orr will report on the
more immediate pressure the ruling puts on President Bush to make a
decision about whether to pardon Libby.

 

Some known sex offenders have been nabbed in Texas for violating their
parole - thanks to MySpace. Hari Sreenivasan will report on how the
social-networking site is helping police track predators. 

 

Watching Saturday morning cartoons might soon be a little less sweet.
Kellogg's says it will no longer advertise its sugary cereals and snacks
to kids. That's due to a lawsuit, but child-health advocates hope the
move influences other marketers, Nancy Cordes will report.

 

There's a mystery at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta: Something's
killing the whale sharks, Mark Strassmann will report.

 

Finally, Kelly Wallace met a pair of doctors who are among the country's
top prostate cancer researchers. But they're not just in the same field
- they're siblings. Both got their love of science from their dad - and
their life-long mission as well.

 

I hope you'll join us for these stories and more,

Explorer tests GridSearch's performs on the test set     (basically evaluating the filter/classifier combination that was      determine to work best on the training data, step 3e) 5. go to 2 for next train/test split 6. output the results averaged over the cross-validation train/test     splits Notes: - the internal cross-validations within GridSearch are run on the    training set, i.e., the 90% that the Explorer hands over to the    classifier. - the filter is always run on the data (before 3a and before 3c); if    you don't use the filter, set it to weka.filters.AllFilter which won't    modify the data. - In case of LibSVM, if you're only optimizing the complexity and the    gamma, then the filter setup will stay the same throughout the search.

Message-ID: <20080224204213.0ECED1AAE8C@alpha.uhasselt.be> Content-Type: text/plain;	charset=""iso-8859-1"" Hello, Basically, your approach seems ok by me. However, it's difficult to say if there is a better approach, since it's not clear what the purpose of your analysis is. Do you want to find which words often occur together in the same sentence? And what would you need this information for? Or do you want to use the association rules for classification? Without knowing the ultimate goal, I find it difficult to answer some of your questions. To counter the heapsize problem, you might want to try the PredictiveApriori. I don't know if this will solve your problem, but with this algorithm you can set the number of rules you want to mine and the algorithm adjusts the confidence and support during the mining process. This might increase the speed of the mining process. I don't know if it will also solve your memory problem (actualy, I doubt it, but you might want to try it) Secondly, about splitting the data into several data sets, I am afraid that this will not work, since Apriori uses the minimum support as a treshold. By splitting the data, a specific rule might fall below the minimum treshold in one of the datasets, which will not allow you to recalculate the support of the itemset over all the datasets. But if you set the minimum support to zero, you avoid this problem, and you probably can combine the support values over the different data sets.  Thus, by setting the minimum support to zero, you can probably split the data and mine all the association rules for each data set and combine the results in the end. This allows you to solve your memory problem. However, with a minimum support of zero, the apriori algorithm becomes a ""dumb"" algorithm which simply calculates the support and confidence of all possible itemsets in your data. This will probably provide you with a new problem, i.e. processing power/time.  Dividing the keysets, which means splitting the instances, doesn't seem a solution to me. If item A is in dataset 1 and item B is in data set 2, there is no way to find a rule like A==>B.  If your final question actually means that you want use a specific set of keywords for the premise of the rule and another set of keywords for the consequence of the rule, you could change the java code for the apriori algorithm.

Hi,   I am using Java & Weka to try to find out the association rules for a set of keywords (35,000+ keywords) in a large text (around a million sentences). I am doing teh following: Algorithm used : Apriori Number of keywords = N Number of sentences in text = K 1. Create N Attributes - each attribute corresponds to one unique keyword - attribute name=keyword, attribute value=0 or 1 . 2. Create K sparse instances - each instance represents a single sentence - each instance contains N number of attributes (representing the keywords), with value 1 if that keyword is present in that particular sentence. 3. Run buildAssociations for Apriori. I have following concerns : - Am I doing this correctly? Is there any other efficient way to do this? - I am getting out of heap space error for buildAssociations when I use all keywords and all sentences. How can I resolve this ? I am already using the -Xmx2024m option. Do I need to divide the text into smaller groups of sentences and then run the code for these seperately ? If so, any guidelines to combine the Association rules results ? If I still get out of heap space error, is there any way to divide the keywords(attributes) into sets of manageable size and then run buildAssociations ? - Is Apriori the right algorithm to use for this purpose? - If I have 2 sets of keywords and I want to find the associations of keywords in set1 with keywords in set2 (using a large text), is there any way to do this ? Any help is appreciated. Thank you in advance.   ____________________________________________________________________________ ________ Looking for last minute shopping deals?

"darren ,
the demand fee is probably the best solution . we can use it to create a
recieivable / payable with tenaska , depending on which way the calculation goes
each month . how are pma ' s to be handled once the fee been calculated and the
deal put in the system ?
attatched is a schedule detailing what is on the gl for cleburne as of
today . some of this info will change by the end of the month . as you can
see , there are some discrepancies between megan ' s calculations and what is on
the general ledger . ua 4 is also on my schedule . unless the buys / sells are
volumetrically balanced , we book an entry to balance the desk . this will
change the calculation of what is due from / to tenaska . should we be
recording a ua 4 entry for cleburne ? is it addressed in the agreement with
tenaska ?

in most cases , ena will be a net buyer from tenaska iv for activity related
to the cleburne plant . however , for october 2000 , the plant was down the
majority of the month and ena sold off the supply , resulting in ena owing
money to tenaska iv .
i have created deal 529856 with a demand of $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , which is the
calculated amount of income on the cleburne desk . ( please see the attached
schedule . ) we need to pass this income on to tenaska iv . do we need to pay
this amount ( wire from ena to tenaska iv ) or is there another way to do
this ? this is the case for october 2000 and could possibly happen again in
the future .
greg , troy , jim - please let me know what you think about settling this .
megan - don ' t pay the amount until we here from the greg , troy and jim .
also , make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we
reimburse tenaska iv .

we have actuals . the larger of the two volumes is 1 , 395 , 000 , which is

problem , though , with the way it is coming to settlements . it is showing up
with a jan 2003 delivery date . i think the demand fee needs to be on 10 / 1
only . right now , it is on a line with a date of 10 / 1 / 00 to 12 / 31 / 36 . i
think this is confusing the system some how . also , we still need the
purchase deal for tenaska iv . it should be for a demand fee of $ 2 , 571 , 135 . 73
booked to the cleburne desk . we actually owe $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , but i need to
net the tenaska iv sales with the purchase to clear those receivables . james
is calling me every day asking for an update . do you know when we will be
able to get this in the system ? i have attached my spreadsheet so you can

"The handy board is so user-friendly you dont have to go to all that
trouble. you control the motor ports using the HB library functions fd,
bk, off, alloff, and motor. fd(int m) and bk(int m) simply turn the
specified motor on (forward or reverse) at full power.  off(int m)
obviously turns motor port m off.  alloff() turns them all off (!) and
the motor(int m, int p) turns motor m on at power level p, where p is
between -100 (full reverse, and 100, full forward); however there are
only 8 real power steps.  because the HB library has already defined
functions to use those ports, your code probably interferes with them. 
i based my first hb robot on the code from the same book, simply taling
out all those functions that the HB already includes in the library.

hope that makes things simpler.

The warnings pragma was introduced in Perl version 5.6

perldoc perl56delta


If you are using Perl version 5.005_03 then you will have to use the -w switch
instead like:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

"Dear Andrew, Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay breaks his silence - Lay is expected to testify in front of a Congressional hearing on Monday. We are planning to provide live coverage of the entire hearing in addition to our regular newscasts. Our Washington bureau will also be reporting live from the hearing every hour with updates. The hearing is one of 12 scheduled in Congress next week related to the Enron collapse.  In addition to appearances by Lay, former CEO Jeff Skilling and former CFO Andrew Fastow will testify Thursday in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The Washington bureau will track this hearing, and any others that may have an impact on the energy sector.  Our Houston bureau will also have reaction to former Enron CEO Ken Lay's testimony in Washington.  In the first legal showdown over electricity deregulation in Texas, two state agencies are entangled in a lawsuit over rates set under the state's deregulation program. The Office of the Public Utility Council is suing the Public Utility Commission over the rates a default provider can charge in the western service territory for TXU Corporation. We'll have all the details from the Houston bureau on Monday.  West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas talks with California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch about the proposed Rate Agreement with the California Department of Water Resources. Lynch says the PUC, DWR and Wall Street made a number of compromises in order for an acceptable deal to materialize.  Director of the California Department of Finance Timothy Gage also talks with Kym about the proposed Rate Agreement between the CPUC and the CDWR. He'll discuss the bridge loans that will hold the state over until $12.5 billion in consumer-backed energy bonds are issued. Gage will also discuss the state's budget crisis and how to secure California's energy future on Monday.  E Source Energy Industry Analyst Matthew Joyce comes to us from Boulder on Monday during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast. Joyce has the latest on what former Enron customers are doing since the fall of the energy giant.  Closing Prices for Friday, Feb. 1, 2002	  	 Crude:	 $20.38/bbl	 +$0.90	  	 Unleaded:	 $0.6034/gallon	 +$0.0292	  	 Heating Oil:	 $0.5531/gallon	 +$0.0215	  	 Gas:	 $2.138/mmBtu	 unchanged	  	 Fwd uE(Mar.):	 $3.61/mmBtu	 +$0.22	 Newscast Update: Starting at 9:30 a.m. ET, we'll have wall-to-wall coverage of former Enron CEO Ken Lay's testimony at a Congressional hearing in Washington. You can view the hearing as it happens by going to the ENL Video Library. We hope you'll take some time to watch this special coverage on Monday.  Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests reschedule or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.  Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Hello,

I would like to suggest changing the .pypirc file format to a format that
can deal with several servers.

This has been discussed here :
http://mail.python.org/pipermail/catalog-sig/2008-January/001607.html

And a summary document is available here:
http://wiki.python.org/moin/EnhancedPyPI (this document also contains a
change ti PyPI server but
this is another point)

A patch was built and enhanced in the last bug day, and is available here:

here is what our customers are saying about the temple  3  ragga dagga ( tm ) phenomenon :
 to whom it may concern ,
i was skeptical when i first read your ad . i grew up in the 70  s temple 3 , but cheaper , and it is legal ! i also have a lot of trouble sleeping , but the capillaris herba made into tea works and smells great ! your products that i tried so far , are as good or better than your ads say ! that is hard to find nowadays in a company . who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius . i will be a customer for life ! also , i talked with a lady on the phone when i was ordering , and asked her to find out if i could get my products and samples to hand out for free . and just send the customers to you . or get a discount on products that i could sell retail to people . i would prefer the earlier one becau !
se , i can just talk about your products , i am a great salesman ( about 10 years experience ) , i could hand out flyers , give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed , etc . . i am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while , maybe indefinitely ? this deal would give me my own products and samples for free ? you would get free advertising , word of mouth , samples into peoples hands to try , someone that is very good with computers , someone who studied about mail order , internet , cold calling , small business , good with people , etc . . i would like to be doing something , even if i would get on social security disability . it is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys , or do a lot of the things i used to do ! at least i would be able to do something worthwhile . and great products makes it real easy to sell . let me know what you think ?
sincerely ,

I'd say it's free. The last sentence seems like an interesting
phrasing of a copyleft clause.

   A certain error is thrown after 30 sequential timeouts.  You could try 
increasing the sleep time to within a millisecond or two of the retrace 
interval.  If the machine is allergic to DMDX trying to determine the state 
of the raster it's conceivable that trying to do less of it might help things.

   The thread has to go to sleep, if it doesn't nothing else executes, the 
machine freezes.  When it goes to sleep it tells the OS I'd like to wake up 
in N milliseconds.  On your machines it gets to wake up much later than it 
asked for.  It's not in DMDX's control.  You happen to have some crappy 
combination of components that's less than excellent for DMDX's 
purposes.  Could be your chipset, your video card, who knows.

  - fixed a problem with packets to ourselves. The packets were being
    processed immediately, but the input routines indirectly assumed
    they were being called as a new event (for example, a calling
    routine might queue the packet, then afterwards modify the ltdb
    record). The solution was to make self packets queue via a zero
    timeout.
  
  - fixed unlinking of the socket in a exit in the lockwait code. Needed
    an _exit instead of exit so atexit() doesn't trigger
  
  - print latency of lockwait delays

>The assertion that science only concerns about beliefs, not about
actions, may be true for basic science, but not for applied science.
Would you say that decision analysis or any of its branches (for
instance, medical decision making) is not science?


I agree with you that applied science concerns actions, as well as beliefs. 
Therefore, IMO, such activities (which may or may not be called ""sciences"") 
are inherently value-laden, not value-free.  This conflicts with the 
standard account of the scientific method in western culture, and is indeed 
recognized in some of these domains, for example, environmental risk 
analysis.    I believe we need models of reasoning which represent values 
explicitly for such domains, which is why I think it undesirable to seek 
single, unified models for reasoning about beliefs and about actions.

further circumspection, I also discovered that the account

holder has long passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. 

 
The bank will approve this money to any foreigner with the correct account information
which i will present on your behalf  because the former operator of the account is a foreigne.

He died in a car accident eight years ago, nobody else knows 
about these funds, and only a foreigner with the legal documents of the account can claim 
this money, so that�s why I need your cooperation for i cannot do this myself or with 
anybody here in my country.


I will provide the necessary information needed in order to claim this money, But you 
will need to provide an account where this money can be transferred. 

 
I wish for utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction as my job and the future

of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached.

 
I want to assure you that the transaction is without risk if due process is followed

20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal .",clean

what is livegraphics 3 d ?
livegraphics 3 d is a non - commercial java 1 . 1 applet to display and

"Baldwin's traveling--meeting with DWR today.  But he knows we want to meet and knows the days we're talking about--left a message with his secretary.  I suspect that, if DWR is free on either Monday or Tuesday, we'll be meeting.

Followed up with Fielder this morning.  He's at an off-site all day and is supposed to call me back COB today.  He knows we want to meet with Craver and offered to set it up.  If he hasn't got it scheduled when I talk to him, I'll go directly to Craver.  I'll hopefully have things more set in stone by end of today or tomorrow by noon.

That work?

Peapod expands on East Coast

Peapod Inc. said it is expanding its delivery area to include 
more areas of the District of Columbia and suburban Maryland in 
the wake of the shutdown of HomeRuns.com. Peapod reportedly has 
seen its orders increase 30% since the rival firm went out of 
business. ""Now, without a competitor there, it may be 
cost-effective to expand,"" Peapod Senior Vice President Mike 
Brennan told the Washington Post. The firm relies on partner 
Giant Food Inc. for in-store advertising. Giant is owned by 
international food chain Royal Ahold.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
HUD, VA foreclosures go to EBay

EBay Inc. said it acquired HomesDirect.com, a Web site offering 
foreclosures at an auction online. The real estate site 
currently auctions all Housing and Urban Development foreclosure 
properties and a majority of Veterans Administration properties, 
the companies said. Indicating real estate will be an important 
growth strategy for eBay, COO Brian Swette said, ""(This) is an 
exciting demonstration of our commitment to providing eBay users 
with the best possible marketplace for the buying and selling of 
homes, land, vacation properties and commercial real estate."" 
Financial terms of the agreement were not released.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Yahoo goes back to school online

Yahoo unveiled a new area on its Web site offering teachers a 
way to create ""virtual classrooms"" online. Instructors can post 
class rosters, calendars and details of courses, and communicate 
with students through private classroom message boards and 
e-mail. Yahoo also announced new agreements with three providers 
of educational reference materials, Bartleby.com, 
Britannica.com, and Houghton Mifflin Co.

Comedy site licenses Universal catalog

Vivendi's Universal Music Group and Laugh.com Inc. signed a 
non-exclusive licensing agreement to provide ""substantially all"" 
of UMG's sound recordings for Webcasting through a 
soon-to-be-released subscription monthly service. Featured 
performers will include Richard Pryor, Dennis Leary, the Jerky 
Boys and Redd Foxx. A message on the Laugh.com site offers few 
details. ""We're not really sure of the particulars ourselves, 
but we are so excited by the idea we had to share it with you. 
Whatever it is,"" the note says.

"Gooday Sir/Madam,

I am Luis Tasharofi  Jnr. I am a collage student of London School of
Economics, U.K. I am compelled to contact you concerning a business
deal,which I believe will be beneficial to you and I.  My father, His
Excellency, Ambassador Krikor Tasharofi was a diplomat. In his lifetime, he 
was an Ambassador emeritus. While in office, he was highly connected because 
of his expertise in transferring money to coded accounts for important 
Clients at short notices and without detection. Due to his  connections in 
high places, at the end of his tenure as an Ambassador, he became acquainted 
with important African leaders, politicians etc who  patronized him to help 
them transfer money out of Africa and this he did with relative ease.

I was quite close to him and was privy to his business deals because he
used to confide in me. I was also aware of his numerous trips to Europe
and theAmericas to make large cash deposits in several Banks. Recently, my 
father came to England en route Liechtenstein to make large cash deposits 
for one of his clients. We met on July 6th, 2005 at his hotel room and on 
July 7th, 2005, I learnt that he was one of the victims of the London Terror 
attack.

After the recovery of his body, I and my other  siblings were making
arrangements for his burial when on July 27th, 2005,one of the
Embassys staff contacted me and informed me that my late father  took him 
into confidence and told him of some boxes kept at the Embassys storage 
house. The Staff also informed me that now that my father was dead,  he had 
no option than to hand the boxes over to me.

Upon collecting the boxes, I opened it and to my surprise, it contains
large sum of money to the Value of US$84 Million US Dollars. I quickly
close theboxes and left it there as the embassy storage house did not know 
what is  the content in the boxes. My problem now is how to move this money 
out ofthe U.K. into a designated Bank account. I have tried to use my late  
fathers old routes to transfer it but met a brick wall and that is why 
Ihave decided to seek for external assistance in the matter.

I can assure you that this business is 100% risk free, as my late
fathers Clients who owns the money would never suspect that I am involved. 
For your assistance I will offer you 20% of the total sum, for your 
assistance so please get back to me as soon as possible to enable me give 
you the details on how we are going to proceed.

1: Full name

2:Direct telephone number and fax

3:An identification of you such as international passport /drivers
license

I eagerly await your urgent response to my private
email.tasharofi-jnr@hotmail.com

Yours truly,

Luis Tasharofi JNR.

"YOU NEED ONLY 15 MINUTES TO PREPARE FOR THE NIGHT OF LOVE!!! 

What is Cialis Soft Tabs?

For men who need to wait 60 or 90 minutes when taking Cialis in a pill form, you can now experience results in 15 minutes or less when using a Soft Tab. Soft Tabs are a faster acting Cialis solution. This is enough time to keep your partner in the mood while the medicine is absorbed into your body. No more planning for sex hours in advance. With Soft Tabs you can be ready when your partner is ready. These pills are just like regular Cialis but they are specially formulated to be soft and dissolvable under the tongue. The pill is absorbed at the mouth and enters the bloodstream directly instead of going through the stomach. This results in a faster more powerful effect which still lasts up to 36 hours. Cialis Soft Tabs also have less sidebacks (you can drive or mix alcohol drinks with Cialis).

following our prc meeting yesterday , here are the high - level facts as i
presented them :
ben parsons , overall : satisfactory . good interpersonal skills , we have
questions on his quant abilities . reluctant to discuss / share his modelling
work , and that which i have seen has too many hand fixes to give me
confidence in his rigour . other enroncredit . com feedback indicates that he
is sometimes prepared to compromise quant analysis to keep the traders happy .
matthew williams , overall : excellent . superior quant skills , excellent
everywhere else . recommended for promotion to senior specialist .
kirstee hewitt , overall : excellent . a solid all - round performance , and a
huge workload . in recognition of the level of responsibility kirstee is
bearing i ' m recommending her for promotion to senior specialist .
sharad agnihotri , overall : excellent . superior quant skills , excellent
everywhere else . very self - directed and commercial - minded . already
operating at manager level in my opinion . flagged for promotion next
mid - year if performance continues at this level .
slava danilov , overall : excellent . superior quant skills , excellent
everywhere else . as a non - commercial - type quant he is hard to fault , but
will probably never work on a trading desk . already operating at manager
level in terms of his depth and rigour of analysis , and the extent to which
he is contributing to the team . flagged for promotion next mid - year if
performance continues at this level .

Can you roll each of the expansions that we discussed into Rod's project model? Michael Ratner will then link those into the TW financial model.

Attached is the actual contract roll off info by segment prepared by Shelley Corman for our bank due diligence.  We need to use this and assume we re-subscribe the roll off capacity at an ""average rate"" - Lindy, we will need your assistance in developing this avg. rate by segment.  For the expansions we discussed, Rod will circulate an expansion model that we can layer into the financial model.
Tracy: call me when you get in and we can discuss.

I have attached a template to use to summarize the capacity rolloff issue discussed today.  I just filled in a bunch of numbers as an example - if they don't make any sense, you can guess why! 
 
Lindy, if you could use this to fill in the required data, then either Michael or I will incorporate it into the TW model.
 
Thanks-

Endgame   

Tuesday, July 3, at 10 p.m. ET/PT

Janet March seemed to have it all - a successful husband, two children,
a dream home and a flourishing art career. But appearances can be
deceiving. All was not well in the March home, and in 1996, Janet
disappeared without a trace.

 

It prompted an international investigation lasting nearly a decade. A
cold case squad would unravel a mystery that included hired hits, an
undercover sting, and a startling confession.

 

Correspondent Bill Lagattuta has spent years following the case of Janet
March, and reports on the surprising outcome.

 

Lagattuta reports for 48 Hours Mystery, tonight at 10 p.m. ET/PT.

Heavy default swap flow Invensys fears
IFR - September 22, 2001
 
Credit default swap quotes drove out last week on heavy trading volume. A rush to buy protection was met with sellers taking profits on existing short positions, or offsetting CDO exposure, and as many as 100 trades a day were seen, though deal size was often US$5m, rather than the standard US$10m.
 
The widening in quotes for airlines continued to draw attention, and most trades referencing airlines required payment of an upfront premium of as much as 20% of the notional total of the trade.
 
The most pressing threat of default may be in a company, which is not directly affected by the terrorist attacks, however. A possible breach on a loan covenant test next week by UK engineering company Invensys could prompt a debt restructuring and the first substantial exercise of default swaps seen in Europe, traders said.
 
Invensys shares collapsed last week on concerns about its debt burden and the price of its default swaps shot up. There were five-year trades seen at 425bp and 475bp, before bids jumped to 700bp, then 900bp. An offer of 1,400bp was available last Thursday, before being pulled on Friday.
 
lnvensys five-year default swaps were trading at l2Obp as recently as early August, and around the 6Obp mark earlier in the year. Traders say that swaps with a notional volume of over US$1bn are outstanding on Invensys, and with the price of its secondary debt already around 70, and set to fall further, there could be substantial pay-outs if a debt restructuring triggers default swap exercises.
 
The overall default swap market was functioning well last week, with market-makers posting two-way prices, albeit at wide bid/offer spreads. The missed lease payment by Continental Airlines has yet to trigger any swap exercise, though fears remain that a major airline will default, and traders are worried that US airline managers may find filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and a shelter from their debts an attractive option.
 
This has led to demands for upfront premium payments on any new US airline default swap trades. Dealers have been asking for US$2m payment on a US$10m trade, to ensure that some money has been gathered in the event that a default is only weeks away. The trades then feature a reduced premium of 200bp or so for a mid-term deal, paid on the usual basis of an annual fee paid quarterly.
 
A rare example of a straightforward US airline default swap last week was a five-year deal in American Airlines at 750bp. British Airways dealt at least as high as 350bp in the five-year.
 
Hotel sector quotes were hit hard, with Hilton trading at least as high as 450bp in the five-year, and prices rose in every sector. GMAC traded at l6Obp in the five-year and Ford at least as high as 165bp, while DaimlerChrysler quotes rose above 175bp.
 
Telecoms company default swaps, which have been among the worst performing this year, bucked last week's trend by holding down relative to other sectors.  Dealers think telecoms companies may benefit from increased demand if business travel is cut.
 
 
Alternative Investment Group Blasts ISDA
Derivatives Week - September 24, 2001
 
The Managed Funds Association, an alternative investment trade group with 700 members, has slammed the International Swaps and Derivatives Association for ignoring a series of letters and e-mails in which it outlined to the derivatives industry body concerns over proposed changes to the 1992 ISDA master agreement. The MFA is worried that changes to the documentation will heavily favor sellside firms. 
 
In several letters and e-mails, the most recent dated April 2, MFA President John Gaine told ISDA that three of the eight proposed amendments to the master agreement ""disproportionately favor dealers to the detriment of end users and may have the unintended consequence of increasing, as opposed to decreasing, systemic risk."" ISDA, said Gaine, did not respond. 
 
Robert Pickel, ISDA executive director in New York, conceded that ISDA never directly responded to the MFA's letters, but asserts the association addressed the MFA's concerns at an August meeting in Washington. ""We've tried to address everyone's concerns,"" said Pickel, adding that those MFA concerns that were not addressed now would likely be revisited in the next 12 months, when ISDA considers revamping the entire master agreement. 
 
However, the MFA disputes this interpretation. ""[ISDA is] drafting this from the dealers side. They weren't looking to sit down with us and work things out,"" complained Pat McCarty, MFA general counsel in Washington. He continued, ""[ISDA] don't even have the decency to send us a written response. We've gone to the trouble of writing a letter to them and they've thumbed their nose at us. I wonder if they even really care about customers."" 
 
ISDA, which began a review of the master agreement last year, was expected to begin the protocol process this week, but as of last Thursday was leaning toward pushing it back a few weeks in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the U.S. The protocol process will entail ISDA working with dealers and end users to incorporate amendments into its trade agreements. 
 
Not every end user shares the MFA's sense of injustice. William Miller, independent risk oversight officer for the End Users of Derivatives Council of the Association of Financial Professionals, which organized the August meeting in Washington, said he is ""very encouraged"" by the attention ISDA paid to end user concerns at the August meeting. He added that ISDA is beginning to realize that in the future it needs to consider end users before it begins drafting changes. 
 
 
Basle relaxes operational risk rules
IFR - September 22, 2001
 
The more flexible stance on operational risk included in the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision's soon-to-be released discussion paper on Basle II's operational risk charge is set to go down well with banks. In the paper, the overall capital charge is lower, and the advanced approach has been opened up to allow banks to use an internal loss-distribution approach or scorecard analysis for operational risk.
 
""It is not as prescriptive about inputs [for operational risk], It's more like market risk,"" said an official at the Bank for International Settlements, noting that certain criteria will have to be met. ""It will be up to national supervisors to judge [banks' internal methodologies],"" he said. The paper will be released before the end of the week.
 
Rather than settle on a benchmark figure for the industry, the Committee's paper will offer a temporary benchmark for illustrative purposes. The temporary benchmark will be based on an analysis
 
of economic capital data from the quantitative impact study conducted earlier this year. A proposal for the level of the floor will be included in the discussion paper, the official said, declining to elaborate.
 
The BIS announced in June that the proposed capital accord's 20% operational risk charge would be reduced after many banks submitted comment letters stating that their internal capital models for operational risk are far lower than 20%. The Basle proposal's operational risk charge resulted from an industry poll undertaken last year. Many banks participating in the survey used a broad definition of operational risk and as such overstated the amount of capital allocated to the risk.
 
 
Rainfall Derivatives
Derivatives Week - September 24, 2001
 
Despite the high exposure of businesses to rainfall risk most weather derivatives that have been traded have been based on a temperature indices. Nevertheless many end users, such as farmers or hydroelectric generators, are sensitive to rainfall magnitude and frequency. The consequences of too much or not enough rain are spread widely and, directly or indirectly, we all suffer from abnormal rainfall magnitudes. 
 
A typical difficulty with risk analysis based on rainfall is that the magnitude and the frequency of rainfall strongly depend on the site where it is measured whereas the temperature is a more ambient measure. By way of example, if at Heathrow the temperature is 20°C then you can assume that the temperature in central London is near 20°C. However, even if it rains heavily in Heathrow you cannot assume that it will rain simultaneously in central London. There is a high positive probably it does, but it is not 100%. 
 
Until now rainfall process studies have been limited to either cumulative rain over a given period, mainly monthly and yearly, or on the rainfall process over a small time period, such as every five or six minutes. The first topic is quite limited and lacks interest for weather derivatives purposes. The second one is very detailed but irrelevant for market transactions. Instead of statistically analysing the rain, it may be preferable to simulate it. 
 
Only Heathrow data are used from now on. 
 
 
Frequency 
The first step in building a stochastic rainfall process is to understand with which probability rainfall occurs. Figure 1 presents the historical frequency rainfall at Heathrow. 
 
The frequency curve is not symmetric and a sinusoidal function might be inadequate to fit it. A smoothing process can be used to correct erratic values (smooth line). Subsequent results are strongly dependent on these probabilities; thus the extraction must be done cautiously. 
 
The Rainfall Persistence 
The probability that it rains depends on the day of the year. But does it also depend on the past? Without doubt in the case of Heathrow, it appears that when the weather is dry, the following day is more likely to be dry than rainy, and vice versa. So the probability that it rains is conditional on the past. But the probability that it rains depends on the time of year. As a consequence, it is more likely to rain two consecutive days during wintertime than in summertime and the reverse in summertime. Therefore a natural autocorrelation is created which interferes with a possible true autocorrelation. 
 
The model of the persistence of rain is set hereafter. 
 
We note Xt the event ""it rains at day t"". Xt is Bernoulli distributed: 
 

 
 
Where 1 is for the event ""it rains"". 
 
We know the historical mean of Xt from our first studies. However, this is insufficient to model the time series Xt. As a matter of fact, assuming the independence of Xt we have E[Xt | Xt-1, Xt-2, Xt-3] = E[Xt] = pt which is different from EH[Xt] (the operator EH is for the historical mean). Therefore the probability pt has a time dependent expectation and is conditional to Xt-1, Xt-2, Xt-3,... 
 
A recurrence is produced to estimate the order of this lag dependence. The probability pt is assumed to be given by: pt = Prob(Xt = 1 | Xt-1, Xt-2 Xt-3 Xt-k), with k IN*. 
 
The aim is to extract the minimum value of k that produces the best fit of the distribution of the length of period of rain. Considering a 365 day year, we assume that E[pt] = E[pt+365] which means that the climate does not vary over years. We first estimate conditional probabilities with k=1, then simulate the process and compare the simulated distribution of the length of the period to the smoothed historical one. Then the method is reproduced with higher values of k until no more information on the probability pt is added. 
 
Assuming independence between successive rainy days we have simulated the rainfall below using the historical probability for 38 years (the same length of period from which the graph below has been calculated). Supposing k=1 a good fit is already obtained: 
 
 
 
The Magnitude Process 
 
Once the length of the rainy period is known the intensity of the rainfall must be evaluated for each day. The previous study didn't reveal a dependence on the length of the rainy period. But studies show that there is a dependence on the length of the period. 
 
Since the average conditional to the previous day is different, the distribution is certainly different. Only four events can be enumerated for a rainy day t under the assumption k=1: Rt-1 / Rt / Rt+1 or NRt-1 / Rt / Rt+1 or Rt-1 / Rt / NRt+1 or NRt-1 / Rt / NRt+1 with Rt the event it rains at day t and NRt the event no rain at day t. Four distributions for each day of the year should be estimated. In order to reduce estimation bias errors a 30-day period bracketing the day for which the distributions are worked out is considered. 
 
The main characteristics are summarised in this table: 
 

 
 
The four distributions are very different from each other. The average (resp. maximum) between the event Rt-1 / Rt / Rt+1and NRt-1 / Rt / NRt+1 is approximately divided by 2.5 (resp. 3.5). One can conclude that the distribution of the magnitude of rainfalls depends on the immediate past and future. 
 
Doing the same for each day of the year, all the required information to run the simulations properly is eventually obtained. First, all the rainy days are simulated and then the magnitude of rain is randomly generated using the correct distribution between the four possible ones for each day. 
 
Conclusion 
Rainfall magnitude is extremely dependent upon the location where it is measured. This risk can be as high as 100% in a single month for close locations, approximately 20 miles. Because the probability that it rains is non-constant during a whole year, this phenomenon creates a natural autocorrelation in the process. This pitfall has to be avoided and the rainfall process can be decompounded into two steps. The first stage is the frequency process and the second stage is the magnitude given the frequency. In order to know the distribution of the rainfall magnitude, it is just as important to know if it rained the previous day as if it will rain the next day.

"First Workshop on Tackling Computer Systems Problems with Machine
Learning Techniques (SysML)
June 27, 2006

Saint-Malo, France
(Co-located with SIGMETRICS 2006)

http://research.microsoft.om/workshops/sysml/

 
 Overview 
 
Recently, more and more computer systems researchers are borrowing
machine learning techniques to attack problems in real-world computer
systems, from reliability and performance issues in large-scale systems
and networks to power efficiency in sensor networks and
self-configuration in complicated systems. The motivation is simple:
building empirical models based on statistical pattern recognition, data
mining, probabilistic reasoning and other machine learning methods
promises to help us cope with the challenges of scale and complexity of
current and future systems.
The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers applying
machine learning techniques to a wide-range of real-world computer
systems and researchers making sure that measurements are robust and
error free and that system performance models are sound. The objectives
are cross-pollination, perspective on the hard problems and
opportunities, as well as discussion of evaluation and validation
methodologies. To this end, we would like to include the diverse
spectrum of systems-related fields, including communication networks,
computer architecture, databases, distributed systems, and operating
systems. Regardless of the specific domain, applying machine learning
techniques requires us to deal with many similar issues, from collecting
training data and interpreting algorithm results to managing false
positives and determining our confidence in inferences drawn from
empirical models. We believe the lessons learned in the context of one
system can give insights to applying machine learning to another.
 
Topics and submissions  
 
We invite authors to submit short position papers or reports of early
work related to current and future applications of machine learning
techniques to solving computer systems problems. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to:

Use of machine learning techniques to address reliability, performance,
security, or manageability issues in computer systems 
New applications of machine learning techniques to computer systems
problems 
Challenges of scale in applying machine learning to large systems 
Experience with on-line data collection and machine learning analysis 
Integration of machine learning techniques into real-world systems and
processes 
We particularly encourage papers describing experience with real-world
systems and lessons likely to be applicable across a variety of computer
systems. Papers will be selected for presentation and/or publication in
the workshop proceedings based on their originality, technical merit,
topical relevance and their likelihood of generating discussion at the
workshop.

All accepted papers will be available online prior to the workshop and
proceedings will be distributed at the workshop. The program committee
will write short reviews (1-3 paragraphs) of accepted papers, giving the
broader communities additional context and perspective.

Submission Instructions  
 
Submitted papers must be no longer than 5 two-column pages (10pt font, 1
inch margins), including all figures and references. The review process
is not blind. Author names and affiliations should be included on the
first page. Details on the submission process will be made available
here in January.

15 seconds is more than enough timeout... There's no request/minute limit,
and we are not close to hardware limits on any of the servers.

subject : killed eol deals
sally asked that i forward the detail of the "" killed "" eol transactions to
both of you . we have emphasized the importance of stressing to our customers
that a deal transacted via enrononline is a binding / legal transaction , but we
have continued to see a few of these deals occur . in summary , we have had a
total of 33 killed transactions since inception , the majority of which have
been with aquila ( 5 ) , koch ( 8 ) , and internal trades ( 13 ) . obviously , the
ones that concern us the most are those transactions with third parties , and
most of these have been due to claimed web latency and transactions not
appearing on the customer ' s summary report . it is important to stress to the
commercial team that the way to "" get out of a trade "" is to do an offsetting
trade or have our legal dept prepare a termination agreement . please feel
free to pass my name on to your respective groups as a point of contact to
work with legal in the case of a terminated deal .

"FYI on budgets.
 
We almost have the total IT depreciation pulled together.
 
The systems development budget is moving down since our meeting.  We are meeting heavily with operations and the business unit heads or their designees to get those numbers down to what is necessary for 2002.
 
Got some agreement on headcount analysis form Wes today and will confirm with all other business units tomorrow so Jenny's budget will be accurate and the projected 2002 headcount accurate as well.
 
Richter is in tough spot trying to roll out the EOL pricing methodology to EA, EGM, EEL and EIM but he is doing the best he can.  The good news is that you know the total and they agree with the total.
 
Operations is almost agreed to.  Most business unit heads are close to their operations person (Bbo Hall, Brent Price, Kevin Sweeney, Beth Apollo) so they trust their budget recommendations.
 
Final complaint is, as expected, indirects but we are trying to get to yes on that.
 
When this is better in a few days, I will e-mail you a new sheet like the one we showed you that has new expenses, new capital and the TOTAL IT depreciation number.

E-MAIL: joel_rose1@mail.com


ATTN:ALHAJI

With due respect, trust and humility, I write you this
proposal, which I believe, would be of great interest
to you. I am Mrs. regina Rossman, the wife of late Mr.
Joseph Rossman of blessed memory, before forces loyal
to
Major Johnny Paul Koromah killed my husband; he was
the Director General of Gold and Mining Corporation
(G.D.M.C.) of Sierra Leone. My husband was one of the
people targeted by the rebel forces. On the course of
the revolution in the country, prominent people were
hijacked from their homes to an unknown destination.

Two days before his death, he managed to sneak a
written message to us, explaining his condition and
concerning one trunk box of valuables containing
money, which he concealed under the roof. He
instructed me to take our son and move out of Sierra
Leone, immediately to any neighboring country. The
powerful peace keeping force of the (ECOMOG)
intervened to arrest the situation of mass killings by
the rebels, which was the order of the day.
Eventually, it resulted into full war, I became a
widow overnight, helpless situation, without a partner
at the moment of calamity, and every person was
running for his life. My son and I managed to escape
to South Africa safely with the box and some documents
of property title.

The cash involved inside the box was US$30 Million
(Thirty Million United States Dollars). Due to fear
and limited rights as a refugee, I deposited the items
with a private security company in order not to raise
an eyebrow over the box here in South Africa in my
sons name JOEL R. ROSSMAN. Be informed that the real
content of the box was not disclosed. Meanwhile, I
want to travel out of South Africa entirely with this
money for investment in your country because of
political and economic stability and for future
benefit of my child.


I want you to assist us claim this box from the
security company and get the money into your private
account in your country so that we can invest the
money wisely. We have in mind to establish a rewarding
investment and good relationship with you.


Concerning the money, we are prepared to give you
reasonable percentage of 30% for your kind assistance.
Also, we have decided to set aside 5% of the total sum
for expenses that might be incurred by the parties in
the course of the transfer both locally and
externally. For the interest of this business, do not
hesitate to contact my son Mr. JOEL R. ROSSMAN on the
above e-mail address immediately you
receive this message for more information and to
enable
us proceed towards concluding all our arrangements. No
other person knows about this money apart from my son
and I. We await your most urgent response.please we
need your fax/phone numbers for esiear communication.

Thanking you for your co-operation and God bless you.


Best regard,

MRS. REGINA ROSSMAN.

Editor's Note


Digital Ink and Pen-Based Computing: Will We Ever Get It Right?


It wasn't that long ago that pen-based computing was the next great thing. Books were written, magazines launched, conferences held, venture capital spent, and press conferences put on. Heck, Dr. Dobb's even held a handwriting recognition contest. But instead of sizzle, the market fizzled, even though some really cool stuff came from it; Go's PenPoint operating system comes to mind. Still, pen-based computing didn't entirely go away (everyone who still uses a PalmPilot please raise your hand). Alas, pen-based computing and digital ink are promising technologies that never lived up to their promises.
But that doesn't mean that everyone has given up on the concept of pen-based computing and digital ink. For instance, Ken Hinckley, a senior researcher in the Adaptive Systems and Interaction group at Microsoft Research, and his team have rolled out a new inking tool called InkSeine that unifies ink, search, and gather functions. The ink component lets you capture freeform thoughts and ideas in handwriting on a page, integrated search gives you quick access to supporting materials and documents with a few simple pen gestures, and gather lets you integrate search results back into your notes. A prototype of
 the InkSeine application is available for download, and this video shows InkSeine in action.
One of the challenges for Hinckley and his team was to create a pen-based experience that's more than a retrofit of a computer and mouse. Let's face it: There are lots of actions that are ill-suited for a pen, but ideal for a mouse--clicking through drop-down menus, navigating folders, and the like. Alternatively, there are other actions that are easier with pens that make use of gestures and strokes. Hmmm, maybe we'll get pen-based computing right this time around.

Now all of a sudden, its okay to have cell phones in your car, at least according to researchers at Nokia and the University of California at Berkeley.

Last fall, we learned that identity fraud is more of a low-tech than a high-tech crime. Now, there's some new evidence that ID fraud is on the decline overall. A new report suggests that financial losses from identity theft dropped 12% in 2007 to $45 billion, down from $51 billion in 2006.Career Center

I attempted to edit the ""Open with Acrobat 6"" to ""Open with
Acrobat 8"".  It didn't take.  So I did a restore.  I will now
just have an open Acrobat 8 around when I care which version is
used.


I am guessing that Adobe Reader 8 (a read-only program) saw that
Adobe Acrobat 6 (a read/write program) was installed.  Therefore
it assumed that the user would want the write potential of the
older program to take precedence over the read-only potential of
the newer program.  It looks to me like there are some inconsistencies
in how it made those arrangements.

I just couldn't get good support and was using a lot of unix-based tools (ported to Winder$) anyway. So, I jumped ship and became my own sysadm.What I got was the easy ability to use a shell (now ssh) to connect to my office box from just about anywhere and use either exmh or nmh (from the command line).  I can do email for the office fairly easily.I haven't seen any other tools that let me do that yet.  But, I have to admit, that some of the web-based mail software is getting pretty close.

Note that $VERSION is begin assigned two values.  No doubt this is a bug.
The CPAN 'r' command shows this:

"Dear adschai, This model is almost surely underidentified, but it's hard to figure that out for sure because of its very odd structure: you have the three latent variables all influencing each other mutually and all with exactly the same observed indicators, but the structural disturbances are all specified to be uncorrelated. Additionally, there are observed exogenous variables that affect the latent endogenous variables, but these exogenous variables are also specified to be uncorrelated. It's hard for me to imagine that you really intended this, and even if the model is identified, I seriously doubt that you can fit it to the data. Finally, you should verify that the input covariance matrix is positive-definite. I think that the issues of model specification go well beyond how to use the software, and I strongly suggest that you try to find someone local to talk to about your research.

"Hello,
	I've been trying to compile  .asm files using as11.exe.  The files I
received with my copy of IC contain the #include directive.  Does anyone
know of a copy of as11.exe that supports this?  If I use as11_ic.bat, to
build an *.icb file, the gcc compiler says that it can't find the include
files, even when I specify the full path.  Why is this?
	Secondly, I am trying to get HexMon to run on my HandyBoard.  It seems to
download correctly,  but is there a quick way to test that it is running
correctly.  Ultimately I want to get the MB_Test program to interface with
it, but it just hangs for now.

Thanks,

It isn't safe to do this much processing in a DllMain.  There is a thing 
called the ""loader lock"" that is held while DllMain is called, and it 
can prevent you from loading other DLLs.  You might try spinning off a 
thread to do your real work.

Do you really think ""w"" is correct for all three of those?

Again, do you really think you want ""w+ for both of these?  How much 
writing will you do to stdin?

Again, you're probably going to want to read from stdin, not write to 
it.  And you don't really need to do the fopen yourself:

    PyFileObject* xout = PyFile_FromString( ""CONOUT$"", ""wb"" );
    PyFileObject* xin = PyFile_FromString( ""CONIN$"", ""rb"" );
    PySys_SetObject( ""stdout"", xout );
    PySys_SetObject( ""__stdout__"", xout );
    PySys_SetObject( ""stdin"", xin );
    PySys_SetObject( ""__stdin__"", xin );

I'm happy to submit a patch, but I want to make sure it makes sense.
Can I get some guidance about the intended approach, please?
